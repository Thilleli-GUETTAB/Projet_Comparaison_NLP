him to pause for thought from charles kennedy. the lib dem leader said david blunkett's resignation was a good opportunity to question whether the legislation was necessary. but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now. id cards are a means to creating a more secure society he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been significantly influenced by the recommendations of the commons' home affairs committee. the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy whose party opposes the id cards plan as deeply flawed said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio 4's today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors. wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary a new broom to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government's plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision. they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven't id cards they are going to be detained. the home office says people will pay 85 for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card. the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards although not to carry them. the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to 1000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to 2500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.\",\n          \"chepkemei hit by big ban kenya's athletics body has suspended twotime london marathon runnerup susan chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year. athletics kenya ak issued the ban after chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in embu. we have banned her from all local and international competitions said ak chief isaiah kiplagat. we shall communicate this decision to the iaaf and all meet directors all over the world. the 29yearold finished second to paula radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 london races and was also edged out in an epic new york marathon contest last year. but the ban will prevent the twotime world halfmarathon silver medallist from challenging radcliffe at this year's london event in april. global sports communications chepkemei's management company said she had wanted to run in the world cross country championships in march. but ak maintained it was making an example of chepkemei as a warning to other kenyan athletes. we are taking this action in order to salvage our pride said kiplagat. we have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us. ka has also threatened threetime women's shortcourse champion edith masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. masai missed the national trials in early february but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. she failed to run in the event citing a leg injury.\",\n          \"ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal's thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze. ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united's controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy's foul on ashley cole for which he got a threegame ban. we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before halftime when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry following the ball attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze's head. the striker protested his innocence  and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two archrivals and praised his own side's behaviour. edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential legbreaker he said. there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal seven on heinze five on ronaldo six by vieira  and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. phil neville got booked for his first challenge. i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. we have always been good at being gracious in defeat. what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement but then they do it all the

it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory under the us department of energy. ibm test results show that blue genel has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. the previous top machine japan's nec earth simulator clocked up 35.86. the top 500 list was announced on monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world. it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second. once completed in 2005 blue genel will be more powerful than its current prototype. next year with the final blue gene four times what it is this year it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat said erich strohmaier one of the cofounders of the top500 list. it will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the us's nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing. it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers. in second place was silicon graphics' columbia supercomputer based at the us space agency's nasa ames research center in california. the linuxbased machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second teraflops in october. it will be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering. the defeated japanese contender the earth simulator which was listed in third place losing the top spot it had held since june 2002. it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. since the first supercomputer the cray1 was installed at los alamos national laboratory us in 1976 computational speed has leaped 500000 times. the cray1 was capable of 80 megaflops 80 million operations a second. the blue genel machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. started in 1993 the top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh.\",\n          \"crucial decision on supercasinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on supercasinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament. the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk one of which is likely to be in glasgow. scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a supercasino will be built in scotland. but opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. the vote is due to be taken on wednesday and is expected to be close. the scottish executive believes that the legislation should be handled by westminster. the new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. a supercasino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre. the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of supercasinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.\",\n          \"iaaf launches fight against drugs the iaaf  athletics' world

agreed that a programme to demystify the issue to athletes the public and the media was a priority. nothing was decided to change things  it was more to have a forum of the stakeholders allowing them to express themselves said an iaaf spokesman. getting everyone together gave us a lot of food for thought. about 60 people attended sunday's meeting in monaco including iaaf chief lamine diack and namibian athlete frankie fredericks now a member of the athletes' commission. i am very happy to see you all members of the athletics family respond positively to the iaaf call to sit together and discuss what more we can do in the fight against doping said diack. we are the leading federation in this field and it is our duty to keep our sport clean. the two task forces will report back to the
