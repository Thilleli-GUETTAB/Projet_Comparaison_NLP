drive to 'save' festive holidays efforts are being made to 'protect' workers' days off on christmas day and new year's day. support is being sought for a bill which would ensure that large retailers in scotland remain closed on christmas day and 1 january. the usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families. msp karen whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season. in recent years more stores have been opening on traditional holidays with some starting their endofyear sale on christmas day or new year's day. ms whitefield said i have found members of the public to be very supportive when i have been campaigning on the streets. the early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family. usdaw general secretary john hannett added christmas day and new year's day are special days for everyone in scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special. they are largely collective days of rest. we want people to tell karen through her consultation whether they want the special nature of these days to remain or whether they want them to become like any other trading day with shops open for business as usual. the consultation on a christmas  new year's day trading bill has so far attracted almost 500 responses and closes on 7 february.,0
brown hits back in blair rift row gordon brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government. jonathan baume of the top civil servants' union spoke of competing agendas between mr brown and mr blair. but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members' jobs. it suited the purpose of mr baume's union the first division association to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms mr brown told bbc radio 4's today programme. under the plans unveiled in the gershon report some 84000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. mr brown said to be honest i don't think you can rely on his mr baume's judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. mr blair and i are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms. he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister he was not in a position to judge. on wednesday ahead of the chancellor's prebudget report mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes conflicting and competing agendas for government between number 10 and the treasury. what the chancellor wanted was not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see mr baume said. government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. the problem is that on many occasions these two don't add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle. number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a soap opera about mr blair and mr brown. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.,0
holmes is hit by hamstring injury kelly holmes has been forced out of this weekend's european indoor athletics championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training. the double olympic champion said i am very disappointed that i have been forced to withdraw. i can hardly walk at the moment and i won't be able to do any running for two or three weeks although i'll be keeping fit as best i can. holmes will have now have intensive treatment in south africa. the 34yearold made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the 1000m title at the birmingham grand prix 10 days ago. after that race and more progress in training holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the european indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend. on saturday night i pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night said holmes. i was going really really well when i felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew. i saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it's frustrating missing madrid when i knew i was in great shape. holmes has now been advised by her coach margot jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer. helen clitheroe now goes to madrid as the only british competitor in the women's 1500m while there will be no representative in the 800m.,1
the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun. the relentless pace of development in the hitech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with 2005 will be the year that thirdgeneration 3g mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003 vodafone launched its consumer service in november orange followed in early december and tmobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and i'll write their obituary said niel ransom chief technology officer at alcatel. instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multimegapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk's first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get highspeed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau principal analyst at telecom view said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wifi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers. moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too. for a start bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip voip. voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection which is now more than 50 of the uk's net using population can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumerfocused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that singlefunction devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.,2
o'sullivan could run in worlds sonia o'sullivan has indicated that she would like to participate in next month's world cross country championships in st etienne. athletics ireland have hinted that the 35yearold cobh runner may be included in the official lineup for the event in france on 1920 march. provincial teams were selected after last saturday's nationals in santry and will be officially announced this week. o'sullivan is at present preparing for the london marathon on 17 april. the participation of o'sullivan currentily training at her base in australia would boost the ireland team who won the bronze three years agio. the first three at santry last saturday jolene byrne maria mccambridge and fionnualla britton are automatic selections and will most likely form part of the longcourse team. o'sullivan will also take part in the bupa great ireland run on 9 april in dublin.,1
argonaut founder rebuilds empire jez san the man behind the argonaut games group which went into administration a week ago has bought back most of the company. the veteran games developer has taken over the cambridgebased just add monsters studios and the london subsidiary morpheme. the argonaut group went into administration due to a severe cash crisis firing about half of its staff. in august it had warned of annual losses of 6m for the year to 31 july. jez san is one of the key figures in the uk's games industry. the developer who received an obe in 2002 was estimated to have been worth more than 200m at the peak of the dotcom boom. he founded argonaut in 1982 and has been behind titles such as 1993 starfox game. more recently it was behind the harry potter games for the playstation. but like all software developers argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. in august it warned of annual losses of 6m blaming delays in signing new contracts and tough conditions in the software industry. the group's three subsidiaries were placed in administration a week ago with mr sans resigning as the company's ceo and some 100 staff being fired. after the latest round of cuts there were 80 workers at argonaut headquarters in edgware in north london with 17 at its morpheme offices in kentish town london and 22 at the just add monsters base in cambridge. mr san has reemerged buying back morpheme and just add monsters. we are pleased to announce the sale of these two businesses as going concerns said david rubin of administrators david rubin  partners. this has saved over 40 jobs as well as the substantial employment claims that would have arisen had the sales not been achieved. mr rubin said the administrators were in talks over the sale of the argonaut software division in edgware and were hopeful of finding a buyer. this is a very difficult time for all the employees there but i salute their commitment to the business while we work towards a solution he said. some former employees are angry at the way cash crisis was handled. one told bbc news online that the staff who had been fired had been financially ruined in the space of a day.,2
'errors' doomed first dome sale the initial attempt to sell the millennium dome failed due to a catalogue of errors a report by the government's finance watchdog says. the report said too many parties were involved in decisionmaking when the attraction first went on sale after the millennium exhibition ended. the national audit office said the dome cost taxpayers 28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. finally a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. more than 550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in greenwich london. the nao report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the dome. deputy prime minister john prescott said a good deal had been secured. delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula he said. but edward leigh who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal. he said this report also shows that the first attempt to sell the dome proved a complete fiasco. every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. the process was confused and muddled. he added four years after the millennium exhibition closed the government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that incredible as it may seem should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. however it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt. nao head sir john bourn said in difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition english partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.,0
parry firm over gerrard listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt. but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future. he told bbc five live steven is above money. he is the future of liverpool. it doesn't matter if it's 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will. on the subject of liverpool's finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield  and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard. on the subject of liverpool's captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same  steven is not for sale. but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa's views. we have reaffirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. we all want to see progress by next season. he's not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim. it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30mplus bid in the summer  but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn't had an offer last summer parry explained. we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. in reality it didn't go beyond that. maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won't. our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven  and he has enough respect for us  to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn't work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. you can forget that. parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool's new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenal's 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground  complete with naming rights  has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eyeopener. i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow  that's interesting.' my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium. some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell. i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to. that's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore. on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there's no need and that is not the way we do business. we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it. steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn't closed on anything. we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year. we have a common interest in making liverpool successful. that's a dream we all share so as far as i'm concerned the door is not closed. i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him. as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don't care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard's quality. through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard's transfer for any fee over 35m. parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly if he isn't then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible nonchampions league football.,1
aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry. the 66yearold criticised his 3000 euros 2060 punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. i am not guilty nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport he said. i'm not a racist and i've never lacked sporting decorum. i've never done that and i have medals for sporting merit. aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal teammate and spanish international jose reyes last october. the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones but was then requested to do so by spain's antiviolence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about 22000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger who was fined 15000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating believes that aragones' punishment was too lenient. you compare his fine and my fine and if you consider his was for racist abuse then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should wenger said. he shouldn't have said what he said and how much money is enough i don't know but it doesn't look a big punishment. however aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. i have been treated like islero the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat. spain's antiviolence commission must now ratify the spanish fa's decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores president of the spanish fa's disciplinary committee said noone in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had acted in a racist way. a fine the highest we could apply is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated flores told sports daily marca.,1
online games play with politics after bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004. the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003 the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean. more than 20 followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media. others helped raise the stakes during the bushkerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtues or his vices. the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multidiscipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers. when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen. i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayanborn researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns. many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. the aim is to comment on international news events via games. the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way. video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website. this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problems could be solved by working together. it's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games. ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs. children learn a lot about the world through play. there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up. but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns. this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a musthave. dr frasca said political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them. it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.,2
ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed. bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication rss that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs makers of the blogger software in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask's my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines said mr lanzone. our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.,2
scots smoking ban details set out smokefree areas will save lives and improve scotland's health first minister jack mcconnell has insisted. he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. mr mcconnell said the country's health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking. he said fines of up to 2500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for noncompliance. earlier the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an allout ban on smoking in public places. in a statement to parliament mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force. the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told msps. he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past. there are still national habits which hold us back  the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared. health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and overeating. they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe and too many smoke. it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health  the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking. the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service miscellaneous provisions bill which will be considered by parliament before christmas. main points of the plan  a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland  the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers  licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of 2500  licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence  a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined  individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of 1000. mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. he said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13 in new york and 16 in ireland. mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and in ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban. the afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning won broad support from opposition parties. the scottish national party's holyrood leader nicola sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. she said the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70 of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations  there are people who are yet to be persuaded. the scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban. he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. mr mcletchie asked would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals the scottish green party's health spokeswoman eleanor scott said she was pleased scotland would be following the success stories of new york and ireland. she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.,0

arsenal through on penalties arsenal win 42 on penalties the spanish goalkeeper saved from alan quinn and jon harley as arsenal sealed a quarterfinal trip to bolton with a 42 victory on penalties. lauren patrick vieira freddie ljungberg and ashley cole scored for arsenal while andy gray and phil jagielka were on target for the blades. michael tonge and harley wasted chances for the underdogs but paddy kenny was inspired to keep arsenal at bay. arsenal stripped of attacking talent such as thierry henry and dennis bergkamp partnered 17yearold italian striker arturo lupoli with ljungberg up front. it was a revamped arsenal lineup and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as tonge wasted a glorious chance. gray ran free down the right flank and his cross left tonge with the simplest of chances but he blazed over the top from six yards. arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes although ljungberg turned a halfchance wide after good work by cesc fabregas. arsene wenger introduced quincy owusuabeyie for the ineffective lupoli at halftime and the pacy dutch youngster had an immediate impact. he ran clear after good work by mathieu flamini but his finish was tame and kenny saved easily. owusuabeyie then fired in a testing cross which was met by fabregas and it needed a desperate clearance by kenny's legs to save the blades. arsenal were now totally dominant and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. it then took a brilliant tackle by jagielka to deny ljungberg as he was poised to strike. arsenal continued to press and once again kenny was called into action with eight minutes left diving low to clutch another closerange effort from fabregas. neil warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when derek geary's cross found harley at the far post but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by almunia. owusuabeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the blades and as extratime began another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for ljungberg. pascal cygan missed arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. arsenal sent on jeremie aliadiere with seven minutes of extratime left and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. kolo toure's misplaced freekick landed at his feet but kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. arsenal laid siege to sheffield united's goal in the dying minutes but they somehow held on to force penalties. almunia was then arsenal's hero as another brave blades cup campaign came to a losing end. kenny geary morgan bromby harley liddell montgomery jagielka thirlwell tonge quinn 97 gray. subs not used francis kabba shaw haystead. morgan. almunia lauren cygan senderos cole fabregas toure 90 vieira flamini aliadiere 113 clichy lupoli owusuabeyie 45 ljungberg. subs not used eboue taylor. clichy lauren senderos. 27595 p dowd staffordshire.,1
game firm holds 'cast' auditions video game firm bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games. the company which makes role playing games such as knights of the old republic and neverwinter nights is seeking people aged 18 to 99. the canadabased company says it was looking for a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters. everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image. the company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in west edmonton alberta on friday and saturday bringing along a piece of photo identification. there are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical bioware game said shauna perry bioware's audio and external resources producer. those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people people with interesting faces. she added not everyone is a model in the world so we don't want just models in our games. people chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. hundreds of photos of the person's head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3d. the 3d model will look exactly like the person  it's really quite incredible how detailed they are said ms perry. she said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. we cannot give people any control over how the images are used. but their face could be used in multiple games  so they could be the hero in one the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.,2
blair says uk tsunami aid to soar tony blair has predicted the british government will eventually give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami. the prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in egypt. mr blair insisted he had been intimately involved in all decisions at all times despite being abroad. he was speaking before the uk joins a threeminute silence at noon across the eu for the estimated 150000 dead. the foreign office says 41 britons are now confirmed to have died in the tsunami which struck south asia on boxing day with 158 others missing. asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday mr blair told bbc radio 4's today programme i don't think this is a situation in which the british people need me to articulate what they feel. i think they feel  as we all do  shock horror and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives. the important thing was action and not words he said adding that of the 50m given by the government so far only six or seven million had been spent. it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. my estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. so we will far and away more than match the generosity of the british people he said. asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest mr blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. as you can see unfortunately i am still looking the same as i always did he joked. the prime minister took personal charge of the uk's response on tuesday chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since boxing day. he also spoke on the telephone to us president george bush and the presidents of sri lanka and indonesia. chancellor gordon brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations. mr brown who was not at the downing street meeting says he has been in intensive talks with other g8 finance ministers. germany proposed a freeze last week and canada has begun its own moratorium. the chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about 3bn 1.58bn in repayments. tory leader michael howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been playing catchup with public donations. foreign secretary jack straw is to visit thailand and indonesia this week. during his trip mr straw will represent the g8 at the international conference called in jakarta indonesia on thursday. on friday he will visit the thai beach resort of phuket where british families are still searching for relatives. international development secretary hilary benn will also visit aceh in indonesia as well as sri lanka. the british public has now pledged 76m in aid with emergency supplies from the british government starting to arrive in the region on three raf flights in a joint operation with scandinavian countries. two ships  the royal fleet auxiliary ship diligence and frigate hms chatham  have arrived in the disaster area. a second royal fleet auxiliary vessel the bayleaf is also being sent. uk charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.  a bbc news special asia remembered including the threeminutes silence will be shown on bbc one and bbc news 24 from 1130 to 1215 gmt on wednesday.,0
'ultimate game' award for doom 3 scifi shooter doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony the golden joystick awards. it was the only title to win twice winning ultimate game of the year and best pc game at the awards presented by little britain star matt lucas. the muchanticipated scifi horror doom 3 shot straight to the top of the uk games charts on its release in august. other winners included grand theft auto san andreas which took the most wanted for christmas prize. only released last week it was closely followed by halo 2 and halflife 2 which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month. but they missed out on the prize for the most wanted game of 2005 which went to the nintendo title the legend of zelda. the original doom released in 1994 heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3d graphics. it helped to establish the concept of the firstperson shooter. doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around 15m 8.3m. the top honour for the best online game of the year went to battlefield vietnam. the chronicles of riddick escape from butcher bay was handed the unsung hero game of 2004. its release was somewhat eclipsed by doom 3 which was released on the same week. it was however very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. electronic arts was named top publisher of the year taking the crown from nintendo which won in 2003. the annual awards are voted for by more than 200000 readers of computer and video games magazines. games awards like this have grown in importance. over the last six years the uk market for games grew by 100 and was worth a record 1152m in 2003 according to a recent report by analysts screen digest.,2
blair says mayor should apologise tony blair has urged london mayor ken livingstone to apologise for his nazi comment to a jewish reporter. labour's mr livingstone who says he is standing by his remarks had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard. mr blair told five's wright stuff show let's just apologise and move on. mr livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked. mr blair who was instrumental in returning mr livingstone to the labour party insisted on wednesday it was time for the london mayor to say sorry. a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time but in the circumstances and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist yes he should apologise he said. let's just apologise and move on  that's the sensible thing. tory leader michael howard asked about mr livingstone's remark by reporters said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. it's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face he said. i think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the labour party. we had what ken livingstone said we had what alastair campbell has said and we have what others have said. i think that's a matter of great regret. the row blew up after mr livingstone was approached by evening standard reporter oliver finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former culture secretary chris smith coming out as britain's first gay mp. on tape mr livingstone who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper is heard asking mr finegold if he is a german war criminal. mr finegold replies no i'm jewish i wasn't a german war criminal. i'm quite offended by that. the mayor then says ah right well you might be but actually you are like a concentration camp guard you are just doing it because you are paid to aren't you at his weekly press conference on tuesday mr livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. if you think they are racist i think you are wrong he told reporters. the dispute comes as an inspection team from the international olympic committee began a fourday tour to assess london's bid for the 2012 games. an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the british jews demanding an investigation by the standards board of england. it has the power to suspend or bar mr livingstone from public office.,0
playstation 3 chip to be unveiled details of the chip designed to power sony's playstation 3 console will be released in san francisco on monday. sony ibm and toshiba who have been working on the cell processor for three years will unveil the chip at a technology conference. the chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new playstation console and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. sony has said the cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games. special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game sony told an audience at the e3 exhibition in los angeles last year. cell could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers and everything in between said kevin krewell the editor in chief of microprocessor report. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. details of the chip will be released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. some details have already emerged however. when put inside powerful computer servers the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations or calculations every second. the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. in the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network said ken kutaragi chief operating officer of sony said last year. current pc architecture is nearing its limits he added.,2
football manager scores big time for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm. indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs. however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together. they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise. si kept the game's code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game. so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation. eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager. so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected. at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year. but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics. it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. but that does not do justice to the game really. what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth. you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland. that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south. of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovich's millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan ... the list goes on a very long way. once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. it might even be a case of champions or else. obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely. then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. then bring on the matches which are once more available in the everimproving top down 2d view. with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed. however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well  things like the manager mindgames which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience. with a game that is so complex and so openended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area. and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybody's satisfaction. but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay. and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. in all there are many more tweaks and improvements. if you were a fan of the previous cm games then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it. if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made. just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas. football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac,2
holmes secures comeback victory britain's kelly holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double olympic gold with 1500m victory at the norwich union international. holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sellout crowd in glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds. it was nice to get that out of the way. i was nervous about whether i would actually be able to get round. i felt good. i just had to relax and use my racing knowledge said holmes. it was all about winning in front of my home crowd. the time is irrelevant. i got round in one piece and didn't disgrace myself. now it's about going forward. the reception i've had since the olympics has been amazing and that's why i wanted to keep running this year because i get a buzz from the crowd. holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of france's hind dehiba and russia's svetlana cherkasova. the olympic 800m and 1500m champion's time was inside the qualifying mark for the european indoor championships in madrid in march. but the 34yearold would not reveal whether she intended to run or not having previously indicated she would leave a decision until after the birmingham grand prix on 18 february.,1
concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england's secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report. the government's response to the plan for a fourtier diploma to replace all existing 1419 qualifications is expected next week. some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and alevels stay. sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday. it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a halfhearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman. his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma  but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. we must tackle headon the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement. it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak. the qualifications and curriculum authority qca has also told the government not to compromise. the qca said the potential stepchange in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener. it is a sign of the qca's concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently. but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills. they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing  whatever spin is put on it. the chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and alevels should go. one of the reasons why i'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said. if we don't say this is a seachange in education we will miss a great opportunity. universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills. in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy  decidedly not gcses. it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval. the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top alevel grade no matter how well the others have done.,0
green fear for transport ballot the green party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in edinburgh's transport referendum. edinburgh city council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital. but green msp mark ballard fears people not on the council's edited electoral register may miss out. local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over nonstatutory matters such as the transport referendum. therefore residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote. however there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of february's voting deadline. mr ballard said this vote will set the future of transport in edinburgh for decades to come. it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas are registered to vote in the ballot. many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say. everyone involved in this debate  both for and against  wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible and that means encouraging people to take part. the ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. the outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. towards the end of february the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.,0
european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects. it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around. the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. but what was great about sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah. and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence. in the men's race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. in fact the men's 60m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid. phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 17.30m which puts him at the top of the world rankings. i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him  but then phillips always has. a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance. he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency  and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far. she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. it wasn't all good news in sheffield. i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. jason gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him. he's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. in the women's race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka. the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection. if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker. janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban. but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her. a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf. findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain. yusuf who came third in the 400m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship. he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent. so we shall have to see what happens to both of them.,1
sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a payasyougo service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. sun grid costs users 1 53p for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. socalled grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries. some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5000 processors each sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each. although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost 12 6.30 because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity ondemand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.,2
'nuclear dumpsite' plan attacked plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the uk have been branded deeply irresponsible by the liberal democrats. the government has confirmed intermediate level waste ilw that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the uk. the cash raised will go towards the uk's nuclear cleanup programme. but lib dem norman baker accused ministers of turning britain into a nuclear dumpsite. under current contracts british nuclear fuels should return all but low level waste but none has ever been sent back. in future only highlyradioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin normally germany or japan under armed guard. intermediate waste from countries such as japan germany spain italy switzerland and sweden will be stored permanently in the uk. at the moment this waste is stored at sellafield in cumbria in the form of glass bricks untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. in a statement the department of trade and industry said the new policy meant there would be a sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries. and it said highlyradioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity. trade secretary patricia hewitt said the new arrangements revealed in a commons written statement would raise up to 680m for britain's nuclear cleanup programme under the new nuclear decommissioning agency. but the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the liberal democrats. mr baker the lib dem environment spokesman said i have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. but now our worst fears have been confirmed. once again britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the treasury and dti. this is a terrible attempt to offload some of the 48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. the energy act was supposed to help britain clean up but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. the nuclear industry is an economic social and environmental millstone that hangs around britain's neck.,0
cherie accused of attacking bush cherie blair has been accused of criticising george w bush's policies in a private address she gave during a united states lecture tour. the prime minister's wife is said to have praised the supreme court for overruling the white house on the legal rights of guantanamo bay detainees. the tories said she broke a convention that british political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad. but downing street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer. it said she was not expressing political opinions. mrs blair's remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in massachusetts. she said the decision by the us supreme court to give legal protection to two britons held at guantanamo bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law. she also described the us legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by mr bush relating to sodomy in texas. bbc news correspondent gary o'donoghue said mrs blair was likely to face further calls for restraint since the us election is imminent. there have been some objections from people reasonably close to the bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election he said. conservatives here too have made their feelings clear. cherie booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career. she has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts. it's not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing.,0
gerrard plays down european hopes steven gerrard has admitted that liverpool have little chance of winning the champions league this season. the 24yearold reds skipper spoke out ahead of tuesday's first leg at home to bayer leverkusen in the last 16 which he will miss through suspension. let's be realistic there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league he told bbc radio five live. we are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year. gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in europe's premier club competition. last season he described qualification for the champions league as the be all and end all  and rumours persist that he will leave anfield if the reds fail to secure a place in the competition. he has consistently been linked with a move away from liverpool with chelsea the favourites to snap up the england midfielder. and blues boss jose mourinho backed gerrard's view that rafael benitez's team could struggle to progress this season. rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team maybe he's a little bit behind right now he told bbc radio five live. gerrard who fired liverpool into the last 16 of this season's competition with a brilliant goal in december's win over olympiakos insisted he was still fully focused on helping liverpool to glory this season. the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table five points off the crucial fourth spot which brings champions league qualification  and they face chelsea in sunday's carling cup final. it's big couple of months for liverpool he added. we're fighting for the fourth spot for the champions league for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions which are very important. we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because financially it is big for the club and personally for myself it is very good.,1
giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday's friendly against hungary in cardiff. john toshack in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark. with the games he's played for united proportionately it doesn't seem that many for wales toshack said. but he's one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it's appropriate he's captain. giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career. i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex but he urged me to carry on giggs said. he feels like myself that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit so in three or four years' time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there. the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough. giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united teammate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17yearold in 1991 an away loss to germany and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a longterm option. for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain it's his 50th cap and he's known for some time about that toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes and giggs said it's my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in. it's important to be here all the players feel the same. it's a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. i see myself leading by example it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons. the way john is looking at things he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament the euro 2006 event. i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament by then i will be 35 so hopefully i will still be okay. a lot can happen but i'm hoping to be around. giggs' own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two. i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment said giggs. it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that. i've heard the suggestions hopefully there is a twoyear deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for to get it sorted out. i'm enjoying my football the way united have been playing and my own form you have to enjoy it. we have massive games coming up manchester city this week then the everton cup tie followed by ac milan in the champions league and my first wales game under john toshack so it's an important time.,1
lord scarman 93 dies peacefully distinguished lawyer lord scarman who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 brixton riots has died aged 93. the peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career serving as law commission chairman in its first seven years. he also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in northern ireland. paying tribute the lord chancellor lord falconer said lord scarman was one of the great advocates of our generation. his legacy from his decisions in the lords and the court of appeal is substantial. his work in the wake of the brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none. a great judge a great lawyer and a great man. lord scarman's nephew george ritchie said the peer who passed away peacefully on wednesday would be sadly missed. the lord chief justice lord woolf who is the most senior judge in england and wales said it was lord scarman's pioneering work which paved the way for the human rights act 1998. he was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society he said. he was personally totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him. dame elizabeth butlersloss the president of the family justice division said lord scarman was a good and humane judge and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. lord scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. during the following three days of disturbances that spread to the midlands merseyside bristol and leeds nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight. the inquiry famously settled on the socalled rotten apples theory which argued that only a few police officers were racist saying most were not. it spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the police complaints authority. trevor phillips chair of the commission for racial equality praised lord scarman's ability to listen. he said when lord scarman toured the streets of brixton his presence was electrifying. a community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the english establishment. his great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds many of whose language he could barely understand genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings. he never lost the special combination of wisdom humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the brixton riots.,0
warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business according to document security firm workshare. up to 75 of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed a survey by the firm revealed. to make matters worse 90 of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding. sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said andrew pearson european boss of workshare which commissioned the research. the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too he said. the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. as documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. microsoft however does provide an addon tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem. the remove hidden data addin is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application says the instructions on microsoft's website. microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document. a tool for apple machines running word is not available. workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average 31 of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to threequarters fell in to the high risk category. often said mr pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared. however the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this socalled metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. the research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as on average only 40 of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft. problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said mr pearson.,2
wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the 31 defeat against bayern munich was our worst peformance in the champions league. kolo toure's late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg but wenger said the only positive is that we are still in the tie. the players are really down in the dressingroom. i feel we really turned in a bad performance. at 30 we faced a real struggle but 31 at least gives us a chance. goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals and wenger said we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment. wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself adding but there is enough time for crying. i could cry  maybe it would be easier  but life goes on. in this job you have good and bad nights. this was a bad night  but i still have confidence in the quality of my players as well as their spirit and desire. but wenger's bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either. he said i am far from happy despite the win. my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal. arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf. arsenal keeper jens lehmann whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result said do i blame myself for the third goal as a goalkeeper i always blame myself. i just know the goals were very easy against us. in my time here we have never conceded three easy goals like that  but sometimes it happens. it would have been impossible to go through at 30  but with the goal we have chances. everything is now possible.,1
smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper. those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones. the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free addons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip. once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with nonworking versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish antivirus lab fsecure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.,2
jowell confirms casino climbdown tessa jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the uk to 24 in a move branded a humiliating retreat by the tories. it puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos originally outlined in the government's gambling bill. instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category  small medium and large. the culture secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling. but conservative shadow culture secretary john whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a shambles. this announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government. instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill to liberalise the rules governing gambling the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present. shares in british casino operators london clubs international rank group and stanley leisure who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos fell by between 10 and 25 following the announcement. ms jowell's deputy richard caborn said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue and responded to the concerns raised. limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling he said. we also believe it's right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos. he added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas. church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos. salvation army spokesman jonathan lomax said the proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the three year trial period which we think should last at least five years will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling. but british british casino association chairman penny cobham said her members were outraged by the decision which followed a campaign in the daily mail newspaper. there was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos. talk of a casino on every high street was just a scaring tactic.,0
solutions to net security fears fake bank emails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say ebusiness experts. trust in online security is falling as a result. almost 70 of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. the survey of more than 1000 people reported that 43 were not willing to hand over personal information online. it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll. an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging ecommerce and ebanking are being taken seriously  by banks in particular. i don't think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website. he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability. ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said. card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. if we do that they will indemnify us he said. many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget. last year a street survey found that more than 70 of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate. on average people have to remember four different passwords. some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. in a separate survey by rsa 80 said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard. activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that. rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a onetime passcode generation service. users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. many companies use a tokenbased method already for employees to access networks securely already. activcard's method is more complex. it is currently trailing its onetime passcode generation technology with uk banks. steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification. the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online. the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both. the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions. you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given. if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction. the clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. the code is validated by the bank's systems matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. each individual gets a key which is unique to them. it is a 2048bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash. it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode. by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they can't prove who they are according to mr ash. in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards. the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them. the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said.,2
lewisfrancis turns to christie mark lewisfrancis has stepped up his preparations for the new season by taking advice from british sprint icon linford christie. the 22yearold is set to compete at sheffield this weekend and will then take on maurice greene and kim collins in birmingham on 18 february. training in wales and getting advice from linford christie is broadening my mind said lewisfrancis. the sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the athens games. last year i was 91kg now i am 86.9kg  hopefully my times will come down he said. this has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks. it is just discipline and being more focused about what i am doing. i am still keeping up my weights work and i can see the improvement in my running. despite playing his part in britain's successful 4x100m relay team lewisfrancis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 olympics. that was heartbreaking but i had made it to the semifinal and for me on a personal level that was an achievement. i just have to be patient and build up for the next olympics. that is my goal and whatever i do between now and then will be geared to making the final.,1
desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday. the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 51 at the nou camp in the champions league quarterfinal second leg in 2000. things will be totally different this time he told bbc sport. now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona. chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarterfinal tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 31 courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg going down to strikes from rivaldo 2 luis figo dani and patrick kluivert. former chelsea captain desailly who is now playing for algharafa in qatar says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team who are top of the premiership. mentally they are much stronger even though a lot of their players are young the 36yearold said. we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000  a lot of them were individual mistakes. it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality. world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for 4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. the whole of chelsea is different now  the chairman the manager and all the players he said. everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. since that game in 2000 chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season. desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar alongside the likes of frank lebeouf josep guardiola titi camara gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday  paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta. i'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level he said. i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays i will continue to play. and it's amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.,1
musical future for phones analyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son's hands. i bought my son max a 3g phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life. after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p800 smart phone. that has a relatively large screen even if it does only have slower gprs access to the network. i can read my email surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen. last week someone emailed me a document that had been compressed into a zip file and i was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me. by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max's 3g phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paidfor services especially the limited web access. the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind microtv. but then max started playing and i realised i was missing the point entirely. it is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself is compelling. the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same size. max was completely captivated and i was intrigued to discover that i had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution. it is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that 'there's never anything worth watching on tv' is hardly going to embrace these phones. but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive 3g adoption. with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service and 3 already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a musthave for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress. this will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3g licences. but it goes deeper than that playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 players. after all why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want streamed to my phone oh  and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone's pocket or handbag available for other uses too. i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip. but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both. i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else. i am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each week. but 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over netbased ip services. the 3g services aren't quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges. vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites  this one for example. this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company's collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom. but we should not see these new phones simply as cutdown network terminals. if i want fast access to my email i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network. the phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of minitv personal communications device and musicvideo player that it really works. there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks. 3g phones and ipods can coexist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket. or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both. an mp3g player anyone bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,2
ajax refuse to rule out jol move ajax have refused to reveal whether tottenham's boss martin jol is on the dutch champions' shortlist to become the amsterdam club's new coach. jol who has coached in his native holland has guided spurs to the premiership's top eight. an ajax spokesman told bbc sport the coach must fit our profile  a coach who understands the dutch league and offensive and distinctive football. we need to find a solution soon so someone is in place for next season. ronald koeman quit as ajax boss last week after their exit from the uefa cup. jol has been linked with the vacant post at ajax with reports saying he has fallen out with spurs' sporting director frank arnesen. but in a statement on spurs' website jol said i'm happy here i'm not in discussion with anyone else i don't want to go elsewhere. ajax have enlisted the help of dutch legend johann cruyff currently a consultant at barcelona to help find a new head coach. cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former rfc waalwijk coach jol has turned round spurs' fortunes since taking over from jacques santini. tonny bruins slot and ruud krol are currently in charge of ajax who are third in the dutch league.,1
premier league planning cole date the premier league is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations chelsea made an illegal approach for ashley cole. both chelsea and arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a premier league commission but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene. it's hard to put a date on it a premier league spokesman confirmed to bbc sport. it's not a formal situation where they've got so much time to respond. arsenal and england defender cole reportedly met blues boss jose mourinho and chief executive peter kenyon in a london hotel 11 days ago. chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting which would be in breach of premier league rule k3. now the gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been tapped up. both clubs have pledged to cooperate with the inquiry which will be conducted on a single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation. cole is in negotiations with the gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007. and his arsenal teammate robert pires has urged the england leftback to stay at highbury. pires told the evening standard he has been at arsenal for ever. he is a very attacking leftback and i think he is enjoying his football because at arsenal he plays in an offensive team. i am not sure he will get the same pleasure at chelsea even though they are doing so well at the moment. i have built a fantastic playing relationship with ashley. we play together so well  we could do it with our eyes shut. but you have to respect the decision of the player. everybody has that right.,1
us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard hp saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs refilling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. hp the world's biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a builtin expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as 34 but it could cost up to 1700 in running costs over an 18month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year. the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk's office of fair trading oft which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.,2
russian exspy on hunger strike an exrussian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for mi6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 downing street. viktor makarov 50 claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities who promised he would live like an average british citizen. but despite a 65000 settlement four years ago he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. other exrussian spies have been given civil service pensions. hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. it can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case  without that it will not work mr makarov told the bbc's newsnight programme. since i came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other. oleg gordievsky a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british said he was very happy with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. commenting on mr makarov's case he said the british state is not a fat cow  it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week. but mr makarov's case has been backed by david kahn  a former yale historian and a leading expert on codebreaking who has confirmed his information was valuable to the western allies. i believe the government of the united kingdom which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities  took the information that victor makarov had wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold mr kahn said. mr makarov joined the kgb in 1970s russia as an idealistic 20 yearold. one of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was vladimir putin. at kgb headquarters in moscow he was posted to the secret 16th directorate  which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the west. by the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant  and was privy to the thoughts of western powers. but he had became deeply disenchanted with the soviet regime  fuelled by its repression both at home and in poland. through his english teacher he made an approach to m16  and then began passing secrets to the british intelligence service. he spied for mi6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to perm 35  a soviet hard labour camp in the artic circle. within a week of his release in 1992 he made contact with the british authorities he'd been spying for who arranged a meeting between him and an mi6 agent in latvia. he was given a false passport and he says promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average uk citizen. but after arriving in london 13 years ago he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. after long periods of living in bedsits with deteriorating health four years ago he took legal action against the government  and settled for 65000 to buy a small house. but he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. government sources told the bbc they had reached a final settlement with the former spy which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.,0
cole faces lengthy injury layoff aston villa's carlton cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury. the striker who is on a seasonlong loan from chelsea picked up the knock in an england under21 match against holland earlier this month. carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge said villa boss david o'leary. i won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. whether he has an operation has got to be left to chelsea. cole who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season was unable to rest because o'leary had a shortage of strikers. the return to fitness of darius vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of luke moore has alleviated some of the villa's manager's problems in that department.,1
klinsmann issues lehmann warning germany coach jurgen klinsmann has warned goalkeeper jens lehmann he may have to quit arsenal to keep his world cup dreams alive. lehmann is understudy to oliver kahn in the german squad but has lost his place to manuel alumnia at highbury. klinsmann said it will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a firstchoice at his club. if jens is not arsenal's number one keeper that is a problem for me. he must be playing regularly. lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the germany squad when the country hosts the world cup in 2006. klinsmann added if he is not playing regularly he cannot be germany's number one keeper or even number two keeper. the situation for jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at arsenal. this could be critical if it remains the same during next season.,1
injury doubts beset wales squad wales have a clutch of injury worries before wednesday's international friendly against hungary in cardiff. west ham's gavin williams ankle looks certain to be out so uncapped wrexham defender stephen roberts is drafted in. defenders danny gabbidon and gareth roberts plus ryan giggs have hamstring concerns while there are also doubts over robbie savage groin. however manchester united winger giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the millennium stadium. there were also doubts over gabbidon's fellow cardiff defender rhys weston but the fullback appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the bluebirds' 10 loss to west ham on sunday. the news leaves wales boss john toshack short in defence for his first game in charge with aston villa's mark delaney injured and james collins with the under21s. that could clear the way for new faces danny collins and dave partridge to make their wales debuts. coyne burnley jones wolves roberts wrexham collins sunderland edwards wolves gabbidon cardiff page cardiff partridge motherwell ricketts swansea roberts tranmere weston cardiff davies tottenham fletcher west ham giggs man utd koumas west brom robinson sunderland savage blackburn williams west ham bellamy newcastle earnshaw west brom hartson celtic.,1
'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001 2002 and 2003 with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash  something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report. if there was to be a cap it should be 10000  a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more smallscale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll  as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations. he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.,0
hewitt decries 'career sexism' plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour's election manifesto the trade and industry secretary has said. patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated but it was an increasingly high priority and a shared goal across government. ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission eoc. mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave  and six unpaid. ms hewitt told the seminar clearly one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. we are looking at how quickly we can do that because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that. ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and taster courses for men and women in nontraditional jobs. women in fulltime work earn 19 less than men according to the equal opportunities commission eoc. the minister told delegates that getting rid of career sexism was vital to closing the gender pay gap. career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex she said. earlier she told bbc radio 4's today programme what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are lowpaid and typically dominated by women so we have got very segregated employment. unfortunately in some cases this reflects very oldfashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women or indeed for men. career sexism is about saying that engineering for instance where only 10 of employees are women is really a maledominated industry. construction is even worse. but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. career sexism goes both ways. she added that while progress had been made there was still a gap in pay figures. the average woman working fulltime is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. for women working parttime it is 60p. the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc. it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of natural differences between the sexes. women hold less than 10 of the top positions in ftse 100 companies the police the judiciary and trade unions according to their figures. and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.,0
sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate onfield action without ever moving from the couch. the two giants in the field  espn and ea sports  have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. the latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair. sports broadcaster espn meanwhile has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. but that status quo was changed forever  or for the next 15 years at least  by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and onair talent meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form. it was a massivemoney deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18000 virtual signatures. many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america191s national football league nfl. so will the sega  espn range be missed a key reason for answering yes is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy. online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which highprofile title rules supreme out of the similaryethugelydifferent fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer 4. on the same note the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. they also both look awesome with the sega  espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front. in terms of gameplay i marginally preferred ea's nba live 2005 for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockeywise by espn's nhl 2k5. the espn games are a touch more arcadelike in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer a dizzyinglyextensive array of ingame tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most diehard of sports fans. perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea's future titles. the frontend decoration of ea's games has become something of an artform in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways. what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting  their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv. they are neat and excellentvalue games in their current form and combining them with ea's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.,2
student 'fee factor' played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland. however lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by 17 between january 2005 and the previous year up 23600 to 27700. fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid topup fees of up to 3000 a year being introduced in england. in june last year mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by 2000 in an attempt to prevent a crossborder flood although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the topup fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all. the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director david caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland's good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study. they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by topup fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated. however it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here. mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge  an additional figure of about 200. also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales where there are no plans for topup fees have also risen by 19. mr wallace said accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held not just in britain. we want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland. we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.,0
uk athletics agrees new kit deal uk athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply great britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years. the germanbased firm kitted out team gb at the 2004 olympics and has deals with 20 other national olympic bodies. uk athletics chief david moorcroft said the athens experience can now be extended to more major championships. in the year ahead these include the european indoor and world outdoor championships. we are delighted. moorcroft added it is hugely beneficial to the sport that the adidas commitment will also provide for officials and other personnel at our worldclass series of live televised events. this week uk athletics also agreed a fouryear deal with energy drink company red bull who will be supplying the product to athletics at major domestic meetings and in high performance centres.,1
when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past. when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially. but says nick donofrio senior vicepresident of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people's lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access. when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture. the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did. these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them. we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week's 2003 technology leader of the year. the hype and overpromise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result. in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren't quite sure that it did anything you weren't quite sure if you needed it you weren't quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool. but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face. it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage. i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air. people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio. trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know. natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances. ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate. to some it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates. but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration. this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. i am confident that the set science engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills he says. if i am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. women tend to have those traits a lot better than men. eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says. in the uk a dtifunded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 representation on set industry boards. ibm according to mr donofrio has 30. our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career. the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio. we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he says. our customers are diverse our clients are diverse. they expect us to look like them. as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.,2
mobiles rack up 20 years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. britain's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline. the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine's dock to vodafone's head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service. mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about 2000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said. they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk. this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. it's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said. cellnet was forecasting half that. now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone. cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched. orange had its uk launch in 1994. both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.,2
coach ranieri sacked by valencia claudio ranieri has been sacked as valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the primera liga club for the second time in his career. the decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the uefa cup. we understand and he understands that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate said club president juan bautista. former assistant antonio lopez will take over as the new coach. italian ranieri took over the valencia job in june 2004 having been replaced at chelsea by jose mourinho. things began well but the spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to racing santander last weekend. that defeat was then followed by a uefa cup exit at the hands of steaua bucharest. ranieri first took charge of valencia in 1997 guiding them to the king's cup and helping them to qualify for the champions league. the 54yearold then moved to atletico madrid in 1999 before joining chelsea the following year.,1
blair hails turkeyeu talks deal tony blair has hailed a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership as important for the world's future peace and prosperity. mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. leaving a brussels summit mr blair said the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership. if it joins turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. mr blair said having turkey in the eu was of importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country britain and the wider world. we are stating a fundamental principle that the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred from europe. on the contrary if it fulfils the same principles of human rights then muslim and christian can work together. under the agreement turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the greek cypriot government but gives turkey more time to sell the idea to its people. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line. it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join and entry cannot be guaranteed. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however talks will begin only if the country cooperates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.,0
joke email virus tricks users a virus that disguises itself as a joke is spreading rapidly across the net. antivirus firms are issuing highlevel warnings about the new version of the bagle email program that seems to be catching a lot of people out. the windows virus grabs email addresses from microsoft outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims. when it infects a machine the bagle variant turns off security measures that usually protect pcs. the new variant is called bagle.at bagle.bb and bagle.au and the attachment bearing the virus code is labelled as either joke or price. the body of the virus usually contains nothing but a smiley or emoticon. the virus can strike computers running windows 95 98 me nt 2000 and xp. users will be infected if they open the attachment that travels with the email. as well as plundering microsoft outlook for email addresses to send itself to bagle.at also tries to turn off the firewall and security centre services on windows xp machines. bbc news online has received five warnings about the virus from security companies. finnish company fsecure gave the virus its second highest threat level. we've had several reports all over the world said mikko hypponen director of antivirus research for fsecure. security firm network box said that it stopped more than 30000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached a peak. black spider said it had stopped more than 1 million copies of bagle.at since the outbreak began at 0630 bst 0530 gmt. antivirus firms urged users to be wary of unexpected email messages bearing attachments and to update their software to ensure they are protected against the latest threats.,2
adriano's chelsea link rejected adriano's agent gilmar rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with chelsea over the striker. chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about inter milan's 22yearold brazilian star. rinaldi told bbc sport from rio de janeiro i can assure you that chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or adriano. parma and real madrid are interested but there's nothing new there. their interest has been known for some time. adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 serie a appearances this season. and chelsea boss jose mourinho had claimed that he was in milan talking to adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with arsenal defender ashley cole. mourinho said he was just practising my portuguese with him because i don't need strikers. rinaldi told bbc sport i have to say that nobody from chelsea or any other london club has contacted me. if they want to that's fine. i can tell them what the situation is. if chelsea are interested then they must make an offer. inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of 40m on the head of adriano who joined them just over a year ago from parma. real madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot ronaldo. but rinaldi said i cannot give you a price that inter would accept for adriano. that's something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs.,1
viewers to be able to shape tv imagine editing titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of star wars to leave you with a bare bones actionfest. manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro 5.1m project funded by the european union. new media for a new millennium nm2 will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. viewers will be able to participate in storylines manipulate plots and even the sets and props of tv shows. bt is one of 13 partners involved in the project. it will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in cctv pictures. the software uses content recognition algorithms. the threeyear project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs. one of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the tv audience. participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. it is being developed in finland and will be shown to finnish tv audiences. another team will work on the bbc's big budget drama of mervyn peake's gothic fantasy gormenghast. it will be reengineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions. the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles explained dr doug williams of bt who will be nm2's technical project manager. the tv at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense he said. at the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive tv which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. we are hoping to occupy the space inbetween he added. nm2's coordinator peter stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience. viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes he said. media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers. it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver from tv producer illuminations television limited which is also involved in the project. it's not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production said mr wyver. the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually by observing the timehonoured rules that go in editing and in terms of the story. only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing he added. mr wyver is planning a production entitled the golden age about renaissance art. it will allow viewers to create a socalled media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry music and architecture. other productions that the nm2 team will make range from news documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.,2
nuclear strike 'key terror risk' the uk and us must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes says a top academic. amitai etzioni a key influence on new labour thinking says the us emphasis on an axis of evil is misplaced. the priority should instead be on failing states including russia and pakistan who cannot properly control their nuclear material he argues. his report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology. professor etzioni was a senior adviser to president carter's white house and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of blairite third way politics. in a report for the foreign policy centre think tank he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations. attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work nor can one rely on preemption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack he says. that means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. we must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction prof etzioni continues. he suggests socalled rogue states such as iran and north korea are less of a problem than failed and failing states which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. he names russia as the failing state of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90 of all fissile material outside america. and he is also worried about pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists abdul qadeer khan admitted leaking nuclear secrets. prof etzioni criticises the us for overlooking those reports suggesting it was done in return for pakistani help in hunting osama bin laden. this is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jaywalkers he says.  upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure  creating a new global safety authority to tackle nuclear terrorism using the intelligence links established in the wake of 11 september  backed by the united nations' authority  encouraging pressuring and using all available means to persuade countries to switch their highlyenriched uranium for less dangerous lessenriched uranium  when possible taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted  compelling failing and rogue states and eventually all states to destroy their nuclear bombs.,0
eu software patent law faces axe the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented. politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially redrafted or even scrapped. the bill was backed by some hitech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile. hugo lueders european director for public policy at comptia an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper. he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament. its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it. also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee juri said the law should be redrafted after it failed to win the support of meps. to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for reconsideration.,2
brown ally rejects budget spree chancellor gordon brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a budget giveaway on 16 march. ed balls exchief economic adviser to the treasury said there would be no spending spree before polling day. but mr balls a prospective labour mp said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. he was speaking as sir digby jones cbi director general warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on preelection bribes. mr balls who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule  with a margin to spare. he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party's chances of winning. expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. consumer borrowing rose at a nearrecord pace in january. if the mpc the bank of england's monetary policy committee were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy  and i'm not predicting that they will  i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour he told a parliamentary lunch. this is a big change in our political culture. during an interview with bbc radio 4's today programme mr balls said he was sure mr brown's budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. i don't think we'll see a preelection spending spree  we certainly did not see that before 2001 he said. his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. his message to the chancellor was please don't give it away in any form of electioneering. sir digby added i don't think he will. i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. stability is the key word  british business needs boring stability more than anything. we would say to him 'don't increase your public spending don't give it away. but if you are going to anywhere just add something to the competitiveness of britain put it into skilling our people'. that would be a good way to spend any excess. mr balls refused to say whether mr brown would remain as chancellor after the election amid speculation he will be offered the job of foreign secretary. i think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a conservative party that will take britain backwards mr balls told today. prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on 5 may.,0
johnson uncertain about euro bid jade johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month's european indoor championships in madrid despite winning the aaas long jump title on saturday. the 24yearold delivered a personal best of 6.50m to win the european trials but had to wait until her final jump after four failures. i don't want to go if i am not going to get a medal said johnson. i will have to see how i am jumping in the next competition and i'll have to have a conversation with my coach. johnson who finished seventh in last year's olympic games has not competed indoors since 2000. and the commonwealth and european silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence. it's the stress said johnson. i am not used to feeling this this early. i am just used to training. but if i'm doing this kind of thing then i will have to see how it goes. johnson next competes in the highclass birmingham grand prix on 18 february.,1
microsoft releases bumper patches microsoft has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs. in its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched. the number of holes considered critical is more than usual. they affect windows programs including internet explorer ie media player and instant messaging. four other important fixes were also released. these were considered to be less critical however. if not updated either automatically or manually pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data. one of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws. stephen toulouse a microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out. often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. a further patch fixes a hole in media player windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. the most important ones are those which are classed as critical. its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker sybari software as part of microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.,2
radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday. back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10000m. bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race. the ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in highprofile and emotional circumstances. sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30yearold must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. there is an old adage 'get straight back on the horse that threw you' richards told bbc sport. paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens. she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment. for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york  win or lose. if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a hasbeen and her profile will suffer. and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues. athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians. she must not get caught up in someone else's agenda. radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30yearold is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york. she just thought 'well they can't think any worse of me now' yelling told bbc sport. she's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it. radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a ticklist of personal goals. her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption. you can't change history warned richards. only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race. the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves. radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon. it's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again said yelling herself a marathon runner. but that is only for longterm health and fitness. when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. so physically it is possible for paula. richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe. the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said. and that just isn't going to be there in new york that's been taken out of the equation. radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time. and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york. how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards. one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities. and yelling says i think this will probably make paula. i think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.,1
virus poses as christmas email security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card. the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected email. antivirus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. antivirus firm sophos said that 10 of the email currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus. like many other windows viruses zafid plunders microsoft outlook for email addresses and then uses mailsending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the email poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces. the virus' subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the email address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the email reads happy holidays and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable antivirus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year. we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads fsecure's antivirus team.,2
retirement age could be scrapped the myth that ageing is a barrier to contributing to society needs to be exploded the work and pensions minister has said. this was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely alan johnson said. it was also committed to stamping out age discrimination and would outlaw it he told a conference on ageing. all three parties have been wooing older voters with both the tories and lib dems pledging higher pensions. mr johnson told age concern's age agenda in london the government was seriously considering introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. this idea has been adopted by the lib dems as policy while the tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. mr johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system. this would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women he said. speaking at the london conference he said generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination. the government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were increasingly consigned to the past. we're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65 and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously. and the review in 2011 which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded. mr johnson said his department had a longterm aspiration of moving towards an 80 employment rate. this would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force he said.,0
smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series. such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries. the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. but smith said bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed. the home international series was done away with in 1984 with the traditional scotlandengland fixture continuing until 1989. that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated. the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season he added. i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20000 fans turned up to watch. england were criticised for the 00 draw against holland  the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies. you have to put a performance on in friendly games. if you don't they can be demotivating. it can be a dangerous road to go down if players don't apply themselves in the manner they should. so i would support the return of the home internationals  the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.,1
security papers 'found in street' an inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the pakistani president's visit to london were found by a member of the public. the files are believed to contain detailed security arrangements for gen pervez musharraf's visit this week including police codes. scotland yard said the policing operation had been reviewed. a spokesman said president musharraf's safety had not been compromised as the papers had been handed in promptly. we cannot discuss who was responsible for the documents only that they contained the policing arrangements for the official visit said the spokesman. the papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in mayfair and given to the mirror newspaper. the police spokesman said the newspaper handed the report over on monday. the force's directorate of professional standards is investigating the circumstances surrounding the loss of the documents he said. gen musharraf held talks with tony blair on monday. he arrived in britain on sunday night after flying from the united states where he met president george w bush. he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon.,0
greek pair attend drugs hearing greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand. they were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the iaaf in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. the pair arrived with former coach christos tzekos to give evidence at the hellenic olympic committee's offices. a decision is expected to be announced before the end of february. whatever the ruling all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. yiannis papadoyiannakis who was head of the greek olympic team at the athens games last year also testified at the tribunal along with other greek sports officials and athletes. i believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution said papadoyiannakis. whatever the athletes have done we must not forget that they have offered us great moments. kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 sydney olympics while thanou won silver in the 100m. they withdrew from the athens games last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. the pair spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. the fivemember tribunal assembled by the hellenic association of amateur athletics is also examining allegations that kenteris and thanou avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games. tzekos was also banned for two years by the iaaf. he faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. all three who have repeatedly denied the allegations have also been charged by a greek prosecutor and face trial for dopingrelated charges. a trial date has not been set. in imposing twoyear suspensions on the duo on 22 december the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as unacceptable. but kenteris' lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical he said. there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.,1
parry relishes anfield challenge bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry. chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history. parry has to deliver a new 60000seat stadium in stanley park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above 120m. he is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football's top table. but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged a reputation as one of football's most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league. liverpool have not won the championship since 1990 a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea manchester united and arsenal. throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate. but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpool's heartbeat  the kop end  parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. he only dodged one question  when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool a polite smile deflected the inquiry. but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business. by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry's mission. parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez. and his enthusiasm for the spaniard's personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. benitez's early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. this will not come as news to parry a lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting... captain gerrard is central to liverpool's plans and parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledges that but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish. in terms of the search for new investment hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004. thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan. morgan had a succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere. morgan however has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his 70m offer. he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool. morgan will certainly not be making another call. so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield. parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool's future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been a vital new development in north london that has reshaped liverpool's thinking. liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights  but the realism of arsenal's stunning 100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape. parry labelled the deal an eyeopener and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'anfield' but the maths of modernday football decree that multimillions for stadium and team could ease the pain. i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him. as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don't care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard's quality. through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard's transfer for any fee over 35m. parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly if he isn't then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible nonchampions league football.,1
dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new antipiracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision. the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping copying programs used to pirate dvds. ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales. the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download. ultimately we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond antipiracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrow's digital home and the upcoming highdefinition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovision's entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard was designed to plug the digital hole that was created by socalled decss ripper software. it circumvents content scrambling system measures placed on dvds and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted dvds in minutes. those copies could then be burned onto a blank dvd or uploaded for exchange to a peertopeer network. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return  where people would rent a dvd copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005 the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs  if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anticopying measures.,2

sprinter walker quits athletics former european 200m champion dougie walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness. walker had hoped to compete in the new year sprint which is staged at musselburgh racecourse near edinburgh on tuesday and wednesday. the 31yearold scot was suspended for two years in 1998 after testing positive for nandrolone. i had intended to race but i'm running like a goon said walker. he told the herald newspaper i'm not in great shape after missing about a month of training. i missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks and then another week working in america. if i'd had a halfdecent mark it might have motivated me more but i won't be racing. i still enjoy training but feel it's time to move on and concentrate on a career.,1

howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards. the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a collective view after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue. he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday. tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo his transport and environment spokesman said the plans stink. he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives. he added when the police say that you have to take them seriously. he acknowledged there were good libertarian arguments against the cards but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the conflicting interests before reaching its decision. i don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken. he also denied he was afraid of looking soft on the issue compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening. sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and deeply flawed. he said this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues' concerns over id cards. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven't id cards they are going to be detained. tory exminister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.,0
unclear future for striker baros liverpool forward milan baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss rafa benitez's plans after being dropped for the carling cup final. baros who is liverpool's leading scorer this season denied reports of a row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench. he told czech newspaper daily sport i don't know why i didn't play on sunday. i didn't argue with anybody. i was disappointed but i am not thinking of leaving right now. the czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 32 to chelsea after extratime. baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting lineup. but his admission that he guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday will do little to quell claims of a fallingout with benitez. and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are not in my mind right now he admitted everything is possible.,1
dibaba breaks 5000m world record ethiopia's tirunesh dibaba set a new world record in winning the women's 5000m at the boston indoor games. dibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 1439.29 set by another ethiopian berhane adera in stuttgart last year. but compatriot kenenisa bekele's record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. ireland's alistair cragg won in 739.89 as bekele battled to second in 741.42. i didn't want to sit back and get outkicked said cragg. so i kept on the pace. the plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what but when bekele made the mistake that was it. the race was mine. sweden's carolina kluft the olympic heptathlon champion and slovenia's jolanda ceplak had winning performances too. kluft took the long jump at 6.63m while ceplak easily won the women's 800m in 201.52.,1
greek sprinters suspended by iaaf greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. athletics' ruling body the iaaf said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were unacceptable. it added that kenteris and thanou had been provisionally suspended pending the resolution of their cases. they face twoyear bans if found guilty by the greek athletics federation. the suspension also covers the athletes' controversial coach christos tzekos. kenteris the 2000 olympic 200m champion and thanou the women's 100m silver medallist from the same games in sydney also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed tests. they failed to appear to give samples in chicago and tel aviv shortly before the athens games and again in athens on 12 august the eve of the opening ceremony. greek prosecutors have also charged them with faking a midnight motorcycle crash which led to them spending four days in hospital. some medical staff have been charged with writing false medical reports. wednesday's statement said the greek federation segas would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations. there will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the greek federation to the court of arbitration for sport the iaaf said. tzekos insisted he and the runners had nothing to hide. the iaaf's decision means nothing he said. we'll be presenting all our arguments to segas  we're innocent.,1
rovers reject third ferguson bid blackburn have rejected a third bid from rangers for scotland captain barry ferguson bbc sport has learnt. it is thought blackburn want 6m for the midfielder but chief executive john williams has confirmed the club are still in dialogue with rangers. the 26yearold has already handed in a transfer request at ewood park as he seeks a return to ibrox. but the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for ferguson who moved to lancashire in 2003 for 6.5m. on thursday rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of 4m. blackburn have said all along that they want 6m for the midfielder and williams has rejected proposals from rangers over a playerswap deal. williams said we are in dialogue with glasgow rangers but we have no agreement. the negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on monday when the winter transfer window shuts. williams conceded any deal for ferguson was looking unlikely before the close of the transfer window but rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. we have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with glasgow rangers he added. the way things are looking i think it is unlikely we are going to. the ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment. it is understood that blackburn accepted a 5m offer for ferguson from everton at the weekend. but the player is determined to return to scotland and rejected a move to goodison park. ferguson did not play in the fa cup win over colchester on saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with rovers boss mark hughes claiming it had been an emotional and difficult time for the player.,1
us top of supercomputing charts the us has pushed japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm's prototype blue genel machine. it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory under the us department of energy. ibm test results show that blue genel has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. the previous top machine japan's nec earth simulator clocked up 35.86. the top 500 list was announced on monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world. it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second. once completed in 2005 blue genel will be more powerful than its current prototype. next year with the final blue gene four times what it is this year it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat said erich strohmaier one of the cofounders of the top500 list. it will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the us's nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing. it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers. in second place was silicon graphics' columbia supercomputer based at the us space agency's nasa ames research center in california. the linuxbased machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second teraflops in october. it will be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering. the defeated japanese contender the earth simulator which was listed in third place losing the top spot it had held since june 2002. it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. since the first supercomputer the cray1 was installed at los alamos national laboratory us in 1976 computational speed has leaped 500000 times. the cray1 was capable of 80 megaflops 80 million operations a second. the blue genel machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. started in 1993 the top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh.,2
search wars hit desktop pcs another front in the ongoing battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened. by the end of 2004 microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a pc hard drive. the move is in answer to google's release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs. the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google aol yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files. microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. john connors microsoft's chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year. we're going to have a heck of a great race in search between google microsoft and yahoo he said. it's going to be really fun to follow. microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of lookout software in early october. on 14 october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find email messages spreadsheets text files and presentations. the software will also find webpages and messages sent via aol instant messenger. many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too. companies such as blinkx copernic enfish x1 technologies and xfriend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the tiger operating system. due to follow are net giants aol and yahoo. the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of windows codenamed longhorn. however this is not likely to appear until 2006. the recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keywordbased web search said kathy rittweger cofounder of blinkx. finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist. desktop search has become important for several reasons. according to research by message analysts the radicati group up to 45 of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in email messages and attachments. jf sullivan spokesman for email software firm sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work. the key thing is being able to manage all this information he said. also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet. many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net. many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using. having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online. for companies such as google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money. but this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools.,2
no to royal succession shakeup a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males. the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown. it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. but the government refused to back lord dubs' succession to the crown bill saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues. the lord chancellor lord falconer agreed the 1701 act of settlement which governs the succession was discriminatory but added that for all practical purposes its effects are limited. the changes proposed by lord dubs were a complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues he said. lord falconer said there were 22 members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales  all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form he added. he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons. lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords but urged the government to think again at a later stage. we cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult he told peers. during the debate the labour peer and former minister said the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. what we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics. but opponents of the bill including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester the rt rev michael scottjoynt said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith. such a secular state would be markedly less tolerant rt rev scottjoynt argued.,0
wenger signs new deal arsenal manager arsene wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until may 2008. wenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a longterm contract that takes him beyond the opening of arsenal's new stadium in two years. he said signing a new contract just rubberstamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions. i still have so much to achieve and my target is to drive this club on. these are exciting times for arsenal. the 55yearold frenchman told arsenal's website www.arsenal.com my intention has always been clear. i love this club and am very happy here. wenger has won the title and the fa cup three times each during his reign. chairman peter hillwood said we are absolutely delighted that arsene has signed an extension to his contract. since his arrival in 1996 he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch. as well as the six major honours he's won during his time here arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium. the club has continued to reap the benefits of arsene's natural eye for unearthing footballing talent. we currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of worldclass players who are playing a wonderful brand of football. meanwhile arsenal director danny fiszman is looking for wenger to stay beyond 2008. when we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation. i'm sure we will want him to stay on and i hope he will too said fiszman.,1
kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a zero tolerance drive education secretary ruth kelly has suggested. ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received spiritual support from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs. the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the runup to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one's breakfast with frost it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour. but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled. i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision. it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school who sexually abuse pupils or other people who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei which means work of god in latin have provoked controversy. critics say the organisation which adheres strictly to catholic teachings is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group ms kelly said i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right. but those are private spiritual matters and i'm sure you'll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life. she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas she argued. the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and alevels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins. ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place he said. she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children teachers and parents.,0
portable playstation ready to go sony's playstation portable psp will go on sale in japan on 12 december. the longawaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19800 yen 145 euros when it hits the shelves. at launch 21 games will be available for the psp including need for speed ridge racer metal gear acid and vampire chronicle. sony has not yet announced when the psp will be available in europe and the us but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005. fifa 2005 is back at the top of the uk games charts a week after losing it to rival pro evolution soccer 4. konami's pro evo dropped only one place to two while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title lma manager 2005 in at number seven. tony hawk's underground 2 held its own at three while star wars battlefront inched up to four places to four. there was good news for disney with the spinoff from the shark's tale film moving up the charts into number eight. fans of the gran turismo series in europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. sony has said that the pal version of gt4 will not be ready for christmas. the product is localised into 13 different languages across the pal territories therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in japan it said. gran turismo 4 for the playstation 2 is still expected to be released in japan and the usa this year. halo 2 has broken video game records with preorders of more than 1.5 million in the us alone. some 6500 us stores plan to open just after midnight on tuesday 9 november for the game's release. halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the united states said xbox's peter moore. we've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'halo 2 flu' on 9 november.,2
'more to do' on adult literacy the government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive a report says. the national audit office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750000 adults in england gaining basic qualifications by this year. but a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed creative ideas. some 26 million adults lack maths or english skill levels expected of schoolleavers. according to the report more than half the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. these are defined as adults by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. the number of these people gaining qualifications was rising slowly. auditor general sir john bourn said higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit england both socially and economically. more people will have the opportunity to live richer lives. in 2001 the government launched the get on scheme  aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. sir john said substantial progress had been made since adding that this was only the beginning. the government and its partners would need to be creative and responsive. some 3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. the report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas so courses can be set to meet local demand. existing adult learners could use their enthusiasm commitment and local knowledge to attract other people. the department for education and skills could also use more personalised learning and work with voluntary groups councils and employers. it should also assess adult learners' progress at frequent intervals the report adds. when the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month prime minister tony blair said it was only the start of the journey. an estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. this is thought to cost the uk economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. the qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government's scheme range up to gcse equivalents. get on's participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010 with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. education minister ivan lewis said we will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace. shadow education secretary tim collins said this is the third report in two days to highlight labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of schoolleavers without these basic skills but all the government have offered is more talk. liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis added far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.,0
msps hear renewed climate warning climate change could be completely out of control within several decades the scottish environment protection agency is warning a committee of msps. experts are giving evidence on the subject to the scottish parliament's environment committee. officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal uk air travel and boosting electric trains. the evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in scotland. sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases as pollution from transport emissions increases. ecologists are warning msps that scotland may have to accept significant intrusion from wind farms. it is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. experts studying the seas off scotland's west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month. they predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. researchers from the university of the highlands and islands and southampton have been looking at wave heights in the atlantic over the last nine years. the project was conducted jointly by the environmental research institute in thurso which is part of the university of the highlands and islands uhi millennium institute network and the southampton oceanography centre. scientists carried out a series of studies including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the hebrides.,0
mccall earns tannadice reprieve dundee united manager ian mccall has won a reprieve from the sack with chairman eddie thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future. it is understood that mccall would have been sacked if sheffield wednesday manager paul sturrock had been willing to return to tannadice. but sturrock has distanced himself from the position. we're in a difficult situation. we must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel said thompson. ian mccall and i have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the league cup he added. however the continuing speculation is doing no one any good especially as we have several crucial games coming up. the minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only. our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semifinal subject to the draw. all that matters at the present time  is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved. dundee united players had expressed their solidarity with mccall after their side's 30 scottish cup win over queen of the south. we want the boss to stay we don't want someone else coming in said jim mcintyre. hopefully now he gets the chance to stay. keeper tony bullock echoed mcintyre's sentiments. i think all the boys are behind ian mccall he added. at the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do a job on the pitch. on saturday sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with wednesday who are fourth in league one. i've only been here five months and i don't expect to be leaving very very soon he said. i can appreciate the rumours because i've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to dundee united. i can assure you the timescale is not the right one. it dundee united is my team. i had five years there as a coach six as a player two years as a manager  once you've done that kind of thing it's the result you look for. the important thing now is i've come here to do a job and i'm going to try to finish it.,1
blunkett row should end  blair prime minister tony blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding david blunkett. the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fasttracking of a visa application for mr blunkett's exlover's nanny. sir alan budd found a chain of events linked mr blunkett to leoncia casalme's indefinite leave to remain application. at the end of his middle east trip mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact. on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days 120 days faster than the average. but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny  or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. in his first comments since sir alan's announcement mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail. but told bbc news as far as i'm concerned we have drawn a line under that. asked if mr blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point he replied i have made my admiration for david very clear and it remains. he's been a tremendous colleague he's done a great job for us first as home secretary then as education secretary. the future is something we will have to approach in the future. the prime minister shrugged off claims from conservative leader michael howard that he led a grubby government. he said mr blunkett's integrity remained intact he was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. he accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened he said. but i think sir alan budd also accepted there wasn't some conspiracy or coverup and i just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on. earlier mr howard said there does need to be another inquiry a judgeled inquiry. there were so many questions that weren't answered. there was deceit at the heart of government which was not limited to the visa affair he argued. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten also said there was a strong case for a judgeled judicial review. he said next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that. mr blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of sir alan's findings. in a statement the exhome secretary said he accepted the inquiry's findings. he said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.,0
freeze on antispam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spamrelated websites appears to have been put on hold. earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words stay tuned. no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial antispam campaign. lycos europe's make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their pc was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95 capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial. monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline. the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are redrafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words stay tuned. the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick said graham cluley senior technology consultant for sophos. not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.,2

vouchers 'to cut winter deaths' pensioners are being promised energy savings by the liberal democrats as snow and cold temperatures continue. the party says the plans could save the average pensioner 100 every year and cut winter deaths. the government gives 200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60 or 300 where people are over 80. the tories promise to keep the payments. the lib dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. shadow local government secretary ed davey said the current scheme has helped some older people but this new liberal democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year. the vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. the plan would boost energy conservation says the party  and insulation could save 100 every year for pensioner households so using the money more intelligently than at present.,0
tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future tory government the party has said. the club2school policy would provide up to 250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver afterschool sport. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities. the plans would help tackle the fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world he said. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy. we aim to shift the emphasis on afterschool sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151000 sports clubs in the uk. the tories say labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1 3 and 4 and twofifths of schools at key stage 2 met that target. the tories also claim that of the 750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities only 41m had been spent. but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved  and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.,0
uk's 'useless' quangos under fire the uk has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash  many of which are useless or duplicate each other's efforts a report claims. essential guide to british quangos 2005 author dan lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since labour won power in 1997. he urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. tories and lib dems welcomed the report and called for a slimming down. conservative deregulation spokesman john redwood said the research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos and slimming down the rest. a conservative government will axe 162 quangos as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government. lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhile said instead of the bonfire of quangos new labour had promised there had been an explosion of them. for over two decades under both tory and labour governments these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. liberal democrats would abolish many merge others and make any that remain properly accountable. labour representatives were unavailable for comment. the quango guide follows last year's governmentcommissioned gershon report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector. mr lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost 1.8bn a year  cash he says which appears to be almost entirely wasted. as well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory fiveyear limit on any such body with executive powers. he also listed what he dubbed the nine most useless quangos. they were the british potato council the milk development council the energy savings trust agricultural wages committees the wine standards board the westminster foundation for democracy the football licensing authority investors in people uk and the economic and social research council. mr lewis branded the existence of the 60employee potato council set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets surprising. he said the 80m spent annually on the energy savings trust which promotes renewable energy would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for british homes. and he argued it was absurd to charge farmers for agricultural wages committees which set working and wage standards in the industry when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for 1 an hour. if a football team can afford to pay 27m for wayne rooney why should the taxpayer  not all of whom like football  be forced to fund the football licensing authority to the tune of over 1.1m a year mr lewis asked. the report is published by the efficiency in government unit  a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the economic research council and the centre for policy studies. it says before a new public body is set up an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.,0
choose hope over fear  kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election said charles kennedy. in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and populist scares. he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been very heartening to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties. the general election would be a threeparty struggle as the conservative party fades away as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands he said. a clear division is emerging in british politics  the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. labour is counting on the politics of fear ratcheting up talk of threats crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are reworking their populist scares about asylum and the european 'menace' he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties. it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials curbing of rights to protest increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. but at the same time an overmighty state is a dangerous one he said. his party instinctively understood the new liberal britain which is no longer a nation with one family structure and one colour he said. we are less deferential more inclined to think for ourselves more open about sexuality and equality. our national institutions are changing too. we are no longer a nation of one church we are a nation of many faiths. in our attitudes and the way we live our lives this is in many ways a liberal britain.,0
'blog' picked as word of the year the term blog has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a us dictionary publisher. merriamwebster said blog headed the list of most lookedup terms on its site during the last twelve months. during 2004 blogs or web logs have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. other words on the merriamwebster list were associated with major news events such as the us presidential election or natural disasters that hit the us. merriamwebster defines a blog as a web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections comments and often hyperlinks. its list of most lookedup words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words that everyone likes to look up or those that always cause problems such as affect and effect. merriamwebster said blog was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. the word will now appear in the 2005 version of merriamwebster's printed dictionary. however the word is already included in some printed versions of the oxford english dictionary. a spokesman for the oxford university press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners reflecting its mainstream use. i think it was the word of last year rather than this year he said. now we're getting words that derive from it such as 'blogosphere' and so on he said. but he added it's a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it's got established very quickly. blogs come in many different forms. many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the us such as hurricane or were to do with the us election. words such as incumbent electoral and partisan reflected the scale of interest in the vote. blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the us election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. speculation that president bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. online journals also raised doubts about documents used by us television news organisation cbs in a story about president bush's war record. the immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press. this is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. statistics by web influence ranking firm hitwise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051 of all net visits per day. one of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. according to blog analysis firm technorati the number of blogs in existence the blogosphere has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. according to us research firm pew internet  american life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. in many repressive regimes and developing nations blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.,2
global digital divide 'narrowing' the digital divide between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast according to a world bank report. the world bank questioned a united nation's campaign to increase usage and access to technology in poorer nations. people in the developing world are getting more access at an incredible rate  far faster than... in the past said the report. but a spokesman for the un's world summit on the information society said the digital divide remained very real. the digital divide is rapidly closing the world bank report said. half the world's population now has access to a fixedline telephone the report said and 77 to a mobile network. the report's figures surpass a wsis campaign goal that calls for 50 access to telephones by 2015. the un hopes that widening access to technology such as mobile phones and the net will help eradicate poverty. developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access to mobile networks the report said. africa is part of a worldwide trend of rapid rollout... this applies to countries rich and poor reformed or not african asian european and latin american. a spokesman for the world summit for the information society wsis which is meeting this week in geneva told the bbc news website the digital divide is very much real and needs to be addressed. some financing has to be found to help narrow the divide. on tuesday a meeting of the wsis in geneva agreed to the creation of a digital solitary fund. the fund is voluntary and will help finance local communitybased projects said the wsis spokesman. under the proposals agreed voluntary contribution of 1 on contracts obtained by private technology service providers could be made to the digital solidarity fund. the exact financing mechanism of the fund is to be ironed out in the coming days said the wsis. sixty percent of resources collected by the fund will be made available for projects in least developed countries 30 for projects in developing countries and 10 for projects in developed countries.,2
clarke to unveil immigration plan new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on monday. home secretary charles clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. tony blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no magic bullet. the tories say labour is acting too late while the lib dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system. the government's new fiveyear plan is designed to show how labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election expected to be held in may. ministers deny they have been spurred into action by tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done. instead they say the plans are part of an evolving process aimed at winning public confidence. mr clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants' families and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants. the prime minister on sunday said immigration would be toughened up to ensure only those immigrants with skills the uk really needs will be granted work permits. but he rejected the tories' call for a quota on economic migrants saying no arbitrary figure could reflect the uk's needs. mr blair told bbc radio 4's westminster hour we should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs... the public are worried about this they are worried rightly because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system. but he defended the uk's current regime saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse. tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work argued mr blair. he said we will not be... pretending there is some simple easy way of processing britain's asylum seekers in some other country because no such other country exists. conservative shadow home secretary david davis said the government had failed to remove 250000 failed asylum seekers from the uk and limits on economic migrants had been a shambles. what we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said labour was right to reject the tories' idea of quotas on asylum. but he said it was yet to be seen if mr clarke could deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.,0
labour trio 'had voterig factory' three labour councillors in birmingham were caught operating a voterigging factory an election court has heard. police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a latenight raid in june 2004 the hearing was told. the votes were later counted towards that month's english local elections. the men elected to the aston ward deny collecting votes fraudulently. the judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. deputy high court judge richard mawrey qc told the hearing at the birmingham and midlands institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming general election. the special election court the first in living memory to hear allegations of voterigging opened in birmingham last month. the case against muhammad afzal mohammed islam and mohammed kazi is being brought by local liberal democrat supporters. they claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 june election. ravi sukul counsel for the petitioners accused the three men of being deeply involved in illegal practices. witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off birch road east the court was told. the police were alerted and called to the premises. mr sukul said when the officers arrived there in the middle of the night they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six asian men present. hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table. the police officers left the warehouse but were later ordered back to seize the documents. when the officers left all the envelopes and papers were scattered mr sukul said. when they went back to make the seizure every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope a and sealed. the house was in order. interrupting mr sukul in his opening mr mawrey said what you are saying is these men were operating a voteforging factory on an industrial estate. the court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning where they were mixed in with other ballots. the case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other birmingham councillors in the bordesley green ward claims which are denied. mr mawrey is due to deliver a judgment in their case once the aston petition has been heard. mr afzal mr islam and mr kazi deny conspiring to commit election fraud to deceive the returning officer. the case continues.,0
mps to debate 'euthanasia laws' mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia by the back door. the bill would give legal force to living wills where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. but christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate. ministers insist the mental capacity bill  for england and wales  would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life. the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf which could be challenged by doctors. critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment. an amendment to the bill  specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death  has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith. ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment. mps could vote on it later on tuesday during the bill's report stage debate. the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords before becoming law. the christian medical fellowship cmf and lawyers' christian fellowship lcf said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the back door. peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory not legally binding. cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take he said. the lcf's andrea williams said there were too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors. exlabour minister frank field told bbc two's newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to do away with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets. constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting 750000 people with dementia needed updating. mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened not changed. we are against euthanasia we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law he said. doctors are saying they want more clarity. patients are saying they want more clarity. the making decisions alliance which includes the alzheimer's society age concern mencap and the national autistic society said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity the alliance said in a statement. the british medical association also backs the bill saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty. she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.,0
tsunami debt deal to be announced chancellor gordon brown has said he hopes to announce a deal to suspend debt interest repayments by tsunamihit nations later on friday. the agreement by the g8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries 3bn pounds a year he said. the deal is thought to have been hammered out on thursday night after japan one of the biggest creditor nations finally signed up to it. mr brown first proposed the idea earlier this week. g8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the world bank and the international monetary fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster. mr brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the g8 which britain now chairs. germany also proposed a freeze and canada has begun its own moratorium. the expected deal comes as foreign secretary jack straw said the number of britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached 440.,0
defiant hunts put ban to the test thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in england and wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force. the countryside alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal but vowed to stay within the law. although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence exercising hounds chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. one antihunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in kent. the man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the east kent hunt near ashford. in wiltshire police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. the group from south wales and ireland have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. it is believed more than 270 hunts went out on saturday just one day after the ban came in. they were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country with actor jeremy irons and former minister kate hoey among the supporters. antihunt groups  such as the league against cruel sports  deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity. mike hobday from the league said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police. our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting. however we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across britain. bbc correspondent simon hall at postbridge on dartmoor in the west country said 2000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt. and the bbc's sarah mukherjee with the beaufort hunt in badminton gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt with 150 on horseback. tom heap bbc rural affairs correspondent said it appeared that hunstman had for now been sticking to the new rules. and while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on saturday he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained. before riding out with the hunt former minister kate hoey told crowds we will prevail and this law will have to be overturned. judith moritz in melton mowbray said antihunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of leicestershire but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. the countryside alliance said the meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations. chief executive simon hart said there has been hunting in england for 700 years. this ban may take two or three years perhaps two or three months to unpick. it will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service as broadcasters say. conservative family spokeswoman theresa may said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. suffolk chief constable alastair mcwhirter the association of chief police officers' spokesman on rural policing told the bbc the law would be enforced although the police would not break up hunts. the attorney general lord goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. he said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police in the near future to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.,0
edwards tips idowu for euro gold world outdoor triple jump record holder and bbc pundit jonathan edwards believes phillips idowu can take gold at the european indoor championships. idowu landed 17.30m at the british trials in sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. it's all down to him but if he jumps as well as he did in sheffield he could win the gold medal said edwards. his ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings. idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a commonwealth silver medal to his name. edwards himself kept idowu off top spot at the manchester games. but he believes the european indoors in madrid represent a chance for the 26yearold to prove his credentials as britain's top triple jumper. he has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning said edwards. phillips still needs to be much more consistent. i'm sure a victory in madrid will build up his confidence and selfbelief that he can be best in the world. the qualifying round of the men's triple jump in madrid takes place on friday with the final scheduled for saturday. olympic champion christian olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.,1
downing injury mars uefa victory middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren hopes that stewart downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the 21 uefa cup win over graz ak. the winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as boro booked their place in the last 16. mcclaren said stewart has tweaked a hamstring which is a blow for us. we will assess it in the morning. but i'm delighted with the match result. they say in sport you can win ugly  and we certainly did. mcclaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at the riverside. to be fair to graz they had a gameplan  they knocked the ball forward especially in the first half and we struggled to deal with it. in the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal  but one slip and they were back in it. boro face sporting lisbon for a place in the quarterfinals after the portuguese side saw off feyenoord on thursday. and mcclaren added sporting are technically very good  portuguese sides always are. but the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium  after the first game here  we'll look forward to it. goalscorer jimmy floyd hasselbaink added it wasn't a particularly beautiful match to watch  but they made it difficult for us. we didn't play well at all. but you need a little bit of luck and i think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper. i would have liked to play in holland  that would have been a little bit special to me. but so is going back to portugal  i'll be playing against some lads i played with at boavista.,1
china 'to overtake us net use' the chinese netusing population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says a report. china's net users number 100m but this represents less than 8 of the country's 1.3 billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008. the report says that the country's culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations. already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only 36 of chinese homes have telephones according to reports. net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf233. its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said. net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower. many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life. for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. the most popular way to pay is cashondelivery he said and that's quite a brake to the development of ecommerce. the arrival of foreign banks in china due in 2006 could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower. but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living. a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said. generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it. its real value is as an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world he said. government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else. familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. it's a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower.,2
podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10000 songs which is a lot of space to fill. but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj video jockey adam curry. podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. a podcast is basically an internetbased radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home. they need only a microphone a pc and some editing software. they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free. using technology based on xml computer code and rss  really simple syndication  listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which mr curry has pioneered. the latest mp3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically. mr curry records hosts edits and produce a daily 40 minute podcast called the daily source code. he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry. i was always into technologies and wires he explains. my parents gave me the radio shack 101 project kit which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter. i had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio. mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital. he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show. he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top 20 video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet. at a certain point in 1995 i was driving in on a friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid. you know i'm going do the top 20 countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning. so after i finished the show i quit. i said on air it's been great i've been here for seven years at that point there's something on the internet i've got to go find it and i'll see you later. but mr curry's technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and highspeed internet connections were becoming more widely available. the mp3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before. most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing. listen to 99 of the radio that you hear today it's radio voices and it's fake it's just fake. he wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet. he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like ipods. mr curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him. no one did so he tried to write one himself. he finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked. he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder. doug kaye a californiabased podcaster praises the former mtv vj for what he has done. adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp3 player he explains. people can wake up in the morning pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players. it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia finland brazil even malaysia. one couple broadcasts theirs the dawn and drew show from wisconsin in the us sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners. already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts. chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological knowhow to simply listen. if i were to tell my mom or my motherinlaw to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator they would think i was speaking a foreign language mr mcintyre says. along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music. some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the antiradio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy. for his part adam curry's pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which he says is a badge i'll wear with great honour. to be the johnny carson or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful. and you know what you don't need a hell of a lot of talent. you just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine. and that's good for me. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction.,2
guantanamo four free in weeks all four britons held by the us in guantanamo bay will be returned to the uk within weeks foreign secretary jack straw told the commons on tuesday. moazzam begg from birmingham and martin mubanga richard belmar and feroz abbasi from london have been held by the us for almost three years. they were detained in the cuban camp as part of the usled war on terror. mr straw said the us had agreed to release the four after intensive and complex discussions over security. he said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. all four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government mr straw said. but he added once they are back in the uk the police will consider whether to arrest them under the terrorism act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity. the shadow foreign secretary michael ancram welcomed the return of the four detainees. but he said there were still serious questions both over the possible threat the four pose to the uk and the treatment they received while detained. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said the four had been rescued from a legal noman's land. their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process. azmat begg father of moazzam thanked his lawyers and the british people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. he added if they have done something wrong of course they should be punished but if they haven't they shouldn't have been there. lawyer louise christian who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga said the government should have acted sooner. she said they should at the outset have said quite clearly to the american government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the british government wanted no part of it and wanted guantanamo bay shut down. they didn't do that. they colluded with it. moazzam begg's labour mp roger godsiff welcomed his release but said questions remained unanswered particularly about charges. asked about possible damages mr begg and the other detainees could bring against the us mr godsiff said people get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. i don't see any difference in this case. human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in cuba. amnesty international has called camp delta a major humanrights scandal and an icon of lawlessness. both amnesty and the lobby group guantanamo human rights commission described the release as long overdue. civil rights group liberty said it was delighted but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the uk without charge or trial. director shami chakrabarti called on the government to practise what it preaches and either free or charge 12 detainees at belmarsh and woodhill prisons. law lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. the us has also announced that 48yearold australian mamdouh habib previously accused of terrorist offences will be released without charge from camp delta. five british detainees released from guantanamo in march last year were questioned by uk police before being released without charge.,0
when technology gets personal in 2020 whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass233. by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists or other parts of the body says ian pearson bt's resident futurologist. it's all part of what's known as a pervasive ambient world where chips are everywhere. mr pearson does not have a crystal ball. his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now to guide industries into the future. inanimate objects will start to interact with us we will be surrounded  on streets in homes in appliances on our bodies and possibly in our heads  by things that think. forget local area networks  these will be body area networks. ideas about just how smart small or even invisible technology will get are always floating around. images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. but now a new vision is surfacing where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality form or aesthetics. such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed. so mp3 players  the mass gadget of the moment  will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing says mr pearson. so the gadgets that fill up your handbag when we integrate those into fabric we can actually get rid of all that stuff. you won't necessarily see the electronics. wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up while video tattoos or intelligent electronic contact lenses might function as tv screens for those on the move. however this future of highly personal devices where technology is worn or even fuses with the body itself raises ethical questions. if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing jewellery and skin there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans says baroness susan greenfield. at a recent conference for technology engineering academic and fashion industry experts at the royal society in london neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we can't just sleepwalk into the future. yet this technology is already upon us. researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. mp3 jackets based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves have already appeared in shops. these smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano and microengineering  the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. at the nanoscale materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster lighter stronger and more efficient devices and systems. the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine defence healthcare sports and communications. professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. nanoscale titanium dioxide tio2 coatings give fabrics antibacterial and antiodour properties. these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light. such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance to turn airline seats into super stainresistant surfaces and applied to windows so they clean themselves. dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. if our clothing skin and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring everywhere we go we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. mr pearson picks up the theme pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become cyborgian. his main concern is privacy. we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passerby to know. so we have to make sure we build security in this. if you are wearing smart makeup where electronics are controlling the appearance you don't want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead. as technology infiltrates our biology how will our brains function differently we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this warns baroness greenfield. there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. clearly the organic carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. the cyborg  a very familiar parthuman partinorganic science fiction and academic idea  is on its way.,2
benitez issues warning to gerrard liverpool manager rafael benitez has ordered captain steven gerrard not to play down their champions league ambitions and be more positive. gerrard told the bbc liverpool were unlikely to win the trophy this year. benitez responded i spoke to steven and said to him that in future it's better to think we can win the champions league. why not he said we need winners here and everyone thinking only of winning. i always want to win. benitez added when we lose i only think of solutions. if you only think about winning the next game you don't know what the draw will be. if we can win the next game maybe we will draw a side that isn't so strong or a side with injuries or suspensions. benitez is hoping to win his first trophy since arriving at liverpool from valencia when they play chelsea in the carling cup on sunday in cardiff.,1
freeze on antispam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spamrelated websites appears to have been put on hold. earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words stay tuned. no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial antispam campaign. lycos europe's make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their pc was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95 capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial. monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline. the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are redrafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words stay tuned. the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick said graham cluley senior technology consultant for sophos. not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.,2
england's defensive crisis grows england's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham's ledley king from the squad to face holland. chelsea's john terry and wayne bridge are also out leaving coach svengoran eriksson with a real problem for wednesday's match at villa park. injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad and matthew upson has already pulled out. wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. terry the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand. but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher alongside brown. manchester united's brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february 2003. the 25yearold was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson who has a hamstring injury. and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england. king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england's medical staff. eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further backup having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with a foot injury.,1
fa decides not to punish mourinho the football association will take no action against chelsea boss jose mourinho following his sendingoff in sunday's carling cup final. mourinho who was sent from the touchline for appearing to taunt liverpool fans has been reminded of his responsibilities to the game. but the fa confirmed there will be no further action taken in this matter. mourinho claimed his 'silence' gesture was aimed at the media although they were on the other side of the ground. the former porto coach was forced to watch the climax of his side's 32 victory over liverpool on television after being ushered away from the touchline by fourth official phil crossley. his gesture came after chelsea's equaliser on 79 minutes courtesy of a steven gerrard own goal. mourinho still faces an fa investigation into his allegation that manchester united's players 'cheated' during january's carling cup semifinal at stamford bridge. and uefa could also launch disciplinary action following mourinho's failure to attend a compulsory postmatch press conference after chelsea's champions league defeat at barcelona last week. in addition some time this month chelsea must also answer a charge of failing to control their players during the premiership win at blackburn in february. and a charge of failing to control their supporters following a carling cup meeting with west ham earlier this season is still to be heard. the premier league is also continuing investigations into allegations chelsea officials tapped up arsenal defender ashley cole in january.,1
howard 'truanted to play snooker' conservative leader michael howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall. mr howard said his time at jack's snooker hall in llanelli in the 1950s had not done him any lasting damage. but he told the times educational supplement that truancy was very bad and said firm action was needed. mr howard also called for a return to olevels and more classroom discipline. mr howard eventually left llanelli grammar school  and the snooker hall  to go to cambridge university. he said i don't think it's done me any lasting damage. nor has it made me a snooker world champion. there might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon. i'm just being honest. i think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it. another player who has failed to win snooker's world championship  jimmy the whirlwind  white  has previously admitted missing lessons instead spending his days in smoky halls. tony meo another player and me used to spend all of our spare time there mr white said we loved the game and the atmosphere. school went out of the window. i went for a while and then started taking time off. mr howard's fellow welshman ray reardon  known by his fellow professionals as dracula  won the snooker world championship six times having left school at 14 to work as a miner. and terry griffiths like mr howard from llanelli won the tournament in 1979. it is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at jack's.,0
uk firms 'embracing ecommerce' uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before ecommerce minister mike o'brien says. a governmentcommissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology ict. the report suggests 69 of uk firms are now using broadband and that 30 of micro businesses are trading online. mr o'brien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use but that there were more challenges ahead. the report carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict. it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use by using broadband in increased numbers bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. mr o'brien said the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring. it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years. the government would play its part in cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish mr o'brien said. the clear message the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business. however we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a worldleading eeconomy he added. the international benchmarking study was based on 8000 telephone interviews with businesses of which more than 2700 were uk businesses. it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the world's most industrialised nations.,0
peace demo appeal rejected peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an antiwar demonstration days after the start of the iraq war. they had appealed against a high court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near raf fairford glos in 2003. the police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. sitting on wednesday three appeal court judges dismissed both appeals. they were challenging decisions by two judges in the high court in february this year. it followed action by police when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to raf fairford and forced to return to london under police escort. the demonstrators appealed against a finding by lord justice may and mr justice harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away. the police were urging lord chief justice and lord justices clarke and rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. craig mackey assistant chief constable of gloucestershire police said we have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence. he said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour a smoke bomb and five shields. given these circumstances and the fact that raf fairford and other military installations in the uk had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. from day one we have vigorously defended this decision which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at raf fairford. fairford coach action representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions say they are prepared to take their case to the european court of human rights. their action is supported by amnesty international and liberty.,0

mp's shock at long lost daughter labour mp stephen pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was out of control during the wild 1960s. lucy 36 tracked down mr pound after her birth mother told her he was known as precious at school. despite being told he was a nutter who died at sea she found a reference to mr pound on friends reunited. lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. mr pound found out about it last year. that happened when lucy wrote to his parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father. mr pound who is now married with two other teenage children said i was a nutter and i was a sailor but i wasn't dead. he said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a setup but he then realised all the dates fitted. it was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. i felt guilt in the marrow of my bones said the ealing north mp. i don't blame lucy's mother. i was pretty much out of control. i was 18 when she was conceived. it was a different time  it was pretty wild. mr pound says he rang lucy as soon as he got her letter they met up and have been in contact ever since. describing that first meeting at london's king cross station he said the earth went from under my feet ... we were walking across the euston road and i took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. we were finishing each other sentences. lucy who was adopted by a family from essex wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. mr pound said his wife maggie had been fully supportive and their two children emily 16 and pelham 14 were pleased to have an older sister.,0
mayor will not retract nazi jibe london mayor ken livingstone has again refused to retract a nazi insult made to a jewish reporter. labour's mr livingstone who says he is standing by his remarks had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard. at his weekly press conference on tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. he said to media representatives if you think they are racist i think you are wrong. the mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs who arrived in london on tuesday. i think it is important that the ioc international olympic committee members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget he said. on tuesday the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. two motions were passed by the london assembly which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor's activities on monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments. the mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of examples of intrusion by journalists into his and his family's private life. i don't suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history. but when reporters say to me i'm only doing this because it's my job... that's the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard. we are responsible for our own choices in this life i always have been and so have reporters. an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the board of deputies of british jews demanding an investigation by the standards board of england. it has the power to suspended or bar him from office but mr livingstone said there must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years. i have never in response to any of that modified a policy i believed to be right or modified a position i believed to be right and i don't intend to now. because if i do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers. on tape mr livingstone who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper is heard asking reporter oliver finegold if he is a german war criminal. mr finegold replies no i'm jewish i wasn't a german war criminal. i'm quite offended by that. the mayor then says ah right well you might be but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard you are just doing it because you are paid to aren't you,0
finding new homes for old phones reusing old mobile phones is not just good for the environment it has social benefits too. research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites. the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk. of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year only 25 get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or reuse. the slowly growing mass of unrecycled discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets the equivalent of 9000 tonnes of waste estimates james goodman report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future. it's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around said mr goodman. many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world said mr goodman. far better he said to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. we've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back said mr goodman but there's a strong social argument too. older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. the forum for the future report took an indepth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. it's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network said mr goodman and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones. but the relatively low wages in romania which is one of the poorest countries in europe mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one he said. reconditioned handsets have boosted takeup of mobiles as the report revealed that almost onethird of romanian prepay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. the reused handsets tend to be about onethird of the price of a new handset. georgeta minciu a romanian parttime cleaner said normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. i am a single parent  keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me. this is the only way i can afford to have a phone she said. mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. but he added those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it he said.,2
tories plan migrant health checks noneuropean union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv under plans unveiled by the conservatives. a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down while hiv would be dealt with case by case. leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs. labour said many tests were already done. the lib dems warned both parties against pandering to prejudice. the proposals which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. mr howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in canada new zealand and australia. it's very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that britain enjoys he told bbc radio 4's today programme. government figures suggest tb in england has increased by 25 over the past 10 years. nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad said mr howard. i don't think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem. but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims. the proposals include  people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and 12 months from a high incidence tb country will have to undergo a chest xray.  people coming to settle in the uk permanently from outside the eu will have to demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health.  they will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to impose significant costs or demands on the nhs.  the tests will include a health check chest xrays for tb except for children and pregnant women and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16yearolds. only the discovery of tb will mean people will be automatically denied a visa other conditions will be dealt with on a case by case basis. there is already some screening in place. last year 185000 people were tested for tb at heathrow and gatwick airports only about 200 were found to be infected. and dr john mooregillon of the british lung foundation said tb is not simply imported we are seeing a rise in many sections of the ukborn population as well. the government says the tories are a bit late to the issue. immigration minister des browne quoted its fiveyear plan for immigration and asylum as saying we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in highrisk areas at the entry clearance stage. those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. meanwhile mark oaten liberal democrat home affairs spokesman said this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives. michael howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing and history proves it is a very dangerous one. lisa power head of policy at aids charity the terrence higgins trust said the policy was prejudicebased rather than evidencebased. in fact it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status she said.,0
blair backs 'preelection budget' tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown's prebudget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in a speech in edinburgh the prime minister said thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour's next election campaign planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic  but refused to rule out future tax rises. he told bbc radio 4's today programme no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. that is not what politicians should do it would not be responsible to do. mr brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable lowinflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability which he said was the cornerstone of labour's programme. in a speech at edinburgh's napier university he said labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term. in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity security and stability for all mr blair said. in his prebudget report mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3 and 3.5 for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3  and fear tax rises or spending cuts saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson from the institute for fiscal studies told bbc news he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will in fact be ok. we're not so sure. david page of investec securities said his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of 8bn is way too optimistic. it's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets. conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said i can't find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election. mr letwin accused the chancellor of using fancy statistics to hide public service failures. vincent cable for the liberal democrats called on mr brown to open up the government's books to the national audit office to see if he had met his golden rule. it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending mr cable told mps.,0
gardener wins double in glasgow britain's jason gardener enjoyed a double 60m success in glasgow in his first competitive outing since he won 100m relay gold at the athens olympics. gardener cruised home ahead of scot nick smith to win the invitational race at the norwich union international. he then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat swede daniel persson and italy's luca verdecchia. his times of 6.61 and 6.62 seconds were well short of american maurice greene's 60m world record of 6.39secs from 1998. it's a very hard record to break but i believe i've trained very well said the world indoor champion who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. it was important to come out and make sure i got maximum points. my last race was the olympic final and there was a lot of expectation. this was just what i needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness. i'm very excited about the next couple of months. double olympic champion marked her first appearance on home soil since winning 1500m and 800m gold in athens with a victory. there was a third success for britain when edged out russia's olga fedorova and sweden's jenny kallur to win the women's 60m race in 7.23secs. maduaka was unable to repeat the feat in the 200m finishing down in fourth as took the win for russia. and the 31yearold also missed out on a podium place in the 4x200m relay as the british quartet came in fourth with russia setting a new world indoor record. there was a setback for jade johnson as she suffered a recurrence of her back injury in the long jump. russia won the meeting with a final total of 63 points with britain second on 48 and france one point behind in third. led the way for russia by producing a major shock in the high jump as he beat olympic champion stefan holm into second place to end the swede's 22event unbeaten record. won the triple jump with a leap of 16.87m with britain's tosin oke fourth in 15.80m. won the men's pole vault competition with a clearance of 5.65m with britain's nick buckfield 51cm adrift of his personal best in third. and won the women's 800m with britain's jenny meadows third. there was yet another russian victory in the women's 400m as finished well clear of britain's catherine murphy. chris lambert had to settle for fourth after fading in the closing stages of the men's 200m race as sweden's held off leslie djhone of france. france's won the men's 400m with brett rund fourth for britain. took victory for sweden in the women's 60m hurdles ahead of russia's irina shevchenko and britain's sarah claxton who set a new personal best. italy grabbed their first victory in the men's 1500m as kicked over the last 200 metres to hold off britain's james thie and france's alexis abraham. a botched changeover in the 4x200m relay cost britain's men the chance to add further points as france claimed victory.,1
borders rail link campaign rally campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened. they will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle with a walk at tweedbank. anne borthwick of campaign for borders rail said reopening the waverley line would restore the area's prosperity. msps are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through midlothian to the borders. campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line which could cost up to 100m would be a huge economic boost for the borders. in 2000 borders council said the area's economy had suffered since the closure. ms borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the scottish executive. we are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the waverley line she said. campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle. we believe that it is time for the scottish executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between edinburgh and tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future. ms borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the scottish borders. a study in 2000 which was commissioned by the executive scottish borders council midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise found that a halfhourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs. it also found that a halfhourly service from gorebridge to edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the west coast main line at longtown could also be reinstated.,0
microsoft seeking spyware trojan microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's antispyware software. the spyware tool was only released by microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. stephen toulouse a security manager at microsoft said the malicious program was called bankasha trojan and was being sent as an email attachment. microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an antivirus program. the program attempts to disable or delete microsoft's antispyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users. it may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes. microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. earlier this week microsoft said it would buy antivirus software maker sybari software to improve its security in its windows and email software. microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paidfor antivirus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. the antispyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware  programs which monitor internet use causes advert popups and slow a pc's performance.,2
new drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drinkdrive limits by a third a report says. university college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. the findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. the bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drinkdrive limit. the research carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. he estimates that this would save the country 119m a year. a previous estimate contained in a 1998 department of transport document suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. the findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. professor allsop said reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver's bac blood alcohol content is within 30mg of the current limit. only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times. ministers do not support a lower limit saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. they believe educating drivers is more important. the aa motoring trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drinkdriving. road safety head andrew howard said it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut. parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone. liberal democrat transport spokesman john thurso said drinkdriving remained a major killer with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. he said there had been a 29 drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997 which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drinkdriving. the road safety bill which gets its second reading on tuesday would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court  currently a blood test is needed. it also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. these have been criticised by road safety campaigners including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas leading to more road casualties. in an article for the times newspaper ms dunwoody who chairs the transport select committee says slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. it is quite simple if you hit someone at 30mph they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. if you are going at 40mph nine times out of ten they will die.,0
disappointed scott in solid start allan scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's european indoor championships after a solid debut on the international circuit. the 22yearold scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the jose m cagigal memorial meeting in madrid. it was definitely a learning curve and i certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week said the east kilbride athlete. the race was won by felipe vivancos who equalled the spanish record. sweden's robert kronberg was second with haiti's dudley dorival in third. scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. he won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first iaaf indoor grand prix circuit final. i should have done better than that he said. i felt i could have won it. i got a poor start  but i still felt i should have ran faster. vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while kronberg and dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.,1
gb select holmes for double bid kelly holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month's european indoor championships  despite not yet confirming her availability. the doubleolympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first european indoors in madrid. but uk athletics chief max jones believes it is likely holmes will race. he said it's worth a punt isn't it she's gone back to training. if she's confident she will pick one distance. the programme does not permit both. if holmes does take her place in the gb side she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. under championship rules she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in madrid on 4 march. jones added she was pleased with her run in birmingham at last weekend's grand prix. i am inclined to think she will compete. it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form. and he admitted holmes' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the norwich union gb team. she is a very good team member and is very good to have there he added. meanwhile there is no surprises in the rest of the great britain team announced on tuesday. defending 60m champion jason gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. he will be joined in the event by mark lewisfrancis  runnerup behind him three years ago in vienna  and new boy darren chin. kelly sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against carolina kluft in the pentathlon. sotherton finished third in the olympic heptathlon in athens where the swede took gold. there are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in gb's 46strong team. the championships will be the last to be attended by jones before he retires to be succeeded by dave collins. jones said the olympic games is the overwhelming target for uka and therefore it is beneficial to start the next fouryear cycle with a notsopressurised major games. the european indoor championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. madrid is the first small step on a long journey to beijing and the 2008 olympics but for some of the emerging athletes this will be a very important step. 60m d chin belgrave harriers j gardener wessex and bath m lewisfrancis birchfield harriers. t abeyie woodford green with essex ladies c lambert belgrave harriers. d garland channel islands ac. j mcilroy windsor slough eton and hounslow ac jimmy watkins cardiff aac. ed jackson aldershot farnham and district n speaight belgrave harriers j thie cardiff aac. a baddeley harrow ac m farah windsor slough eton and hounslow ac j mayock barnsley ac. d greaves newham and essex beagles a scott shaftesbury barnet harriers a turner notts ac. b challenger belgrave harriers. pole vault n buckfield crawley ac. n morgan birchfield harriers c tomlinson newham and essex beagles. l achike shaftesbury barnet harriers n douglas oxford city ac p idowu belgrave harriers. d cossins birchfield harriers r davenport gloucester ac d garland channel islands ac r preddy gloucester ac g warburton cardiff aac. k endacott city of plymouth ac j kwakye woodford green with essex ladies j maduaka woodford green with essex ladies. k wall basildon ac. k holmes ealing southall and middlesex ac. h clitheroe preston harriers k holmes ealing southall and middlesex ac. j pavey exeter harriers. d allahgreen trafford ac s claxton belgrave harriers. j crane sale harriers manchester s jones trafford ac. j whitlock trafford ac. j johnson herne hill harriers. k sotherton birchfield harriers. d fraser croydon harriers l mcconnell shaftesbury barnet harriers c murphy woodford green with essex ladies m purkiss southampton ac.,1
global blogger action day called the global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned iranian bloggers. the monthold committee to protect bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 february to the free mojtaba and arash day. arash sigarchi and mojtaba saminejad are both in prison in iran. blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. i hope this day will focus people curt hopkins director of the committee told the bbc news website. the group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take including writing to local iranian embassies. the committee has deemed tuesday free mojtaba and arash day as part of its first campaign. it is calling on the blogsphere  the name for the worldwide community of bloggers  to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other cyberdissidents. if you have a blog the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'free mojtaba and arash day' said mr hopkins. that would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. that alone will shine some light on the situation. if you don't have one find one dedicated to that  it takes about 30 seconds. technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12000 are added daily. a blog is created every 5.8 seconds according to a us research thinktank. the committee to protect bloggers was started by us blogger curt hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger ellen simonetti as a deputy director. she has since started the international bloggers' bill of rights a global petition to protect bloggers at work. although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means it aims to be the hub or organisation information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech. the committee although only a month old aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future and will operate as a nonforprofit organisation. blogging is in this weird no man's land. people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view said mr hopkins. some think of themselves as pundits kind of like journalists and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. but they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold. it is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. the question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal and often anonymous blogs have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in. this is a big messy argument explained mr hopkins. he added it is just such a new way of doing business there will be clamp downs. but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which said mr hopkins is part of the whole messy conversation. if you haven't already got bloggers in your company you will have them tomorrow  and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. mr hopkins said that the blogsphere  which is doubling every five months  was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. everyone does this  mums radicals conservatives he said. many companies offer easytouse services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. that is the essential difference. what i call 'templating software' gives every single person on earth the chance to have one. you don't even have to have your own computer.,2
call for kenteris to be cleared kostas kenteris' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the greek sprinter to be dropped. gregory ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former olympic champion has no case to answer. kenteris and compatriot katerina thanou were given provisional suspensions in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. the greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week. kenteris and thanou withdrew from the athens olympics last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. they were also alleged to have avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games. but ioannidis said everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped. ioannidis also said he has presented evidence that will throw a different light on the events leading up to the pair's sensational withdrawal from the athens games. the lawyer added that he has proof the authorities knew kenteris was in germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in chicago. nick davies spokesman for athletics' ruling body the iaaf which handed out the provisional bans said we can't comment because we were not present at the hearing and don't know what was said behind closed doors. we expect a verdict from the greek athletics federation before the end of february and will obviously be making a statement then. kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 sydney olympics while thanou won silver in the 100m.,1
new delay hits eu software laws a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computerbased inventions. the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact opensource software innovation. there was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. but in the end we could not put it on an eu spokesman told the reuters agency. he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law. in december poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. poland is a large eu member so its backing for the legislation is vital. the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the usbased amazon.com holds a patent for its oneclick shopping service. critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.,2
uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a 4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hivaids. an estimated 25000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. about 800000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader. the fiveyear department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to antiretroviral treatment. the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. it was overshadowed by rwanda's emergence from the 100 days of slaughter during which time the mass killings took place and the women's fate was largely a taboo subject. but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but in many cases orphans too. as the women die the number of rwanda's orphans rises. until recently very few of the women have had access to antiretroviral treatment. that is now starting to change. this funding is intended to make antiretrovirals and other care available for some 2500 women. mary kayitesi blewitt founder of the survivors fund surf one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled said it was a recognition before it was too late that the survivors should be a priority for help.,0
jones files lawsuit against conte marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performanceenhancing drugs. the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking 25m 13m in the suit. conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said i stand by everything i said. jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performanceenhancing drugs. conte's statements the suit added were false and malicious. after the abc television program earlier this month jones' lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performanceenhancing drugs. victor conte is a man facing a 42count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america's most decorated female athletes. mr conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination. mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed. the sport's ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to conte's allegations but contacted the us antidoping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information. but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added. the us antidoping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its antidoping war. and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest. jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us antidoping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march.,1
web helps collect aid donations the web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. highprofile web portals such as google yahoo ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. so many were visiting some aidrelated sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee dec has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. it urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. the site has so far received almost 8 million with more than 11000 donations being made online every hour. telco bt stepped in to take over the secure payments on the dec site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. it has also provided space in london's bt tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations. some of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. among the 17 organisations listed are oxfam medecins sans frontieres doctors without borders and network for good. many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations. online retailer amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the american red cross that will be used with relief efforts. auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. the auction drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. sadly the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. antifraud organisations are warning about emails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies.,2
nhs waiting time target is cut hospital waiting times for patients in wales are to be cut but not to the same extent as those in england. welsh health minister jane hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by march 2006 against a current target of 18 months. but she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for march 2006. the announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop. this current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside wales. details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the new year. in england the current target for inpatients  seeing a consultant to having an operation  is six months. dr richard lewis welsh secretary of the british medical association bma welcomed the new targets to make further and faster progress on waiting lists. however much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because wales still lags a long way behind england he said. capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that welsh patients don't receive a worse service than patients over the border. health analyst tony beddow from the welsh institute for health and social care called the new targets reasonably impressive. on wednesday ms hutt also announced 264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in wales. ms hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year. we are turning the corner on long waits in wales. now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again she said. she added the targets intended to ensure noone waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant. but let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months and these targets affect the small minority of patients in wales that are waiting far too long. rhodri glyn thomas plaid cymru health spokesman said it's exactly the same target she set in 1999 with the qualification that it's dependent on a second offer. it's a failed target from a failed minister..with a failed policy. for the welsh liberal democrats kirsty williams called the new target hugely unambitious. it leaves patients in wales still waiting two years before they're treated. conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said we're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof. the audit commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively and that's quite a criticism. meanwhile the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in wales has fallen by 9.8. statistics to the end of november showed a decline since october from 785 to 708. the number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7613 to 6630 or 12.9. ms hutt said they were excellent figures. there are 305775 people on a waiting list of some kind down from 311764 last month.,0

parties warned over 'grey vote' political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election says age concern. a survey for the charity suggests 69 of over55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17 of 18 to 24 year olds. charity boss gordon lishman said if a decisive blow was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. a total of 3028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension. he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to support us all in an ageing society. older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives mr lishman said. political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote. in the survey carried out by icm research 14 of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. among the over65s 70 said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election compared with 39 of people under 55. age concern says the over55s are united around key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. for 57 pensions and the nhs were key issues while the economy was important for a third and tax was a crucial area for 25.,0
isinbayeva claims new world best pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in lievin on saturday. it was the russian's 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham. the olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on france but failed to clear that height. in the men's 60m former olympic 100m champion maurice greene could only finish second to leonard scott. it was greene's second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow american who also won in birmingham last week. i ran my race perfectly said scott who won in 6.46secs his best time indoors. i am happy even if i know that maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season.,1
claxton hunting first major medal british hurdler sarah claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's european indoor championships in madrid. the 25yearold has already smashed the british record over 60m hurdles twice this season setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the aaas title. i am quite confident said claxton. but i take each race as it comes. as long as i keep up my training but not do too much i think there is a chance of a medal. claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. now the scotlandborn athlete owns the equal fifthfastest time in the world this year. and at last week's birmingham grand prix claxton left european medal favourite russian irina shevchenko trailing in sixth spot. for the first time claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles  which could explain her leap in form. in previous seasons the 25yearold also contested the long jump but since moving from colchester to london she has refocused her attentions. claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the european indoors which take place on 56 march.,1

millions buy mp3 players in us one in 10 adult americans  equivalent to 22 million people  owns an mp3 player according to a survey. a study by the pew internet and american life project found that mp3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young americans. the survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under18s also have mp3 players. the american love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband. of the 22 million americans who own mp3 players 59 are men compared to 41 of women. those on high income  judged to be 75000 39000 or above  are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than 30 000  15000. broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players compared to 9 of those who have dialup access. mp3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. almost one in five us citizens aged under 30 have one. this compares to 14 of those aged 3039 and 14 of those aged 4048. the influence of children also plays a part. sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9 of those who don't. the ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership the survey found. people are beginning to use them as instruments of social activity  sharing songs and taking part in podcasting  the survey found. ipods and mp3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers said lee rainie director of the pew internet and american life project. more growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available as new players enter the market and as new social uses for ipodsmp3 players become popular he added.,2

labour targets 'hardcore truants' a fresh crackdown on persistent truants in england has been launched by education secretary ruth kelly. serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. previous initiatives brought 40000 pupils back to school since 1997 according to official statistics. parenting contracts penalty notices and fast track prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. it is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. tories say labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence where parents are permitted to take children out of school. such absences are often due to family holidays. however serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing 885m. those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. in one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved. the tough stance paid off with just 24 issued while attendance improved in 776 cases. truancy has been reduced by 5 at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's behaviour improvement programme. this is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since september. the new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps  the sixth of which will take place on monday. police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. held twice each year in addition to routine local patrols previous countrywide sweeps have apprehended 31000 pupils dodging school. in almost 14000 of those cases the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. a department for education and skills source said every day in school counts. it is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy.,0
howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees michael howard has said. as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans. by cutting the number of frontline immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. in a speech in london on monday mr howard said it's not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it. he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations.  withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers  introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents  detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk  a worry for national security  stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australianstyle points system and those wanting to join families in the uk. mr howard said nearly 160000 people were settling in the uk every year  the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a substantial reduction in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current unfair and inhumane system. we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said. by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling. but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans dangerous ill thoughtout and hugely irresponsible. lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down 40 and economic migration down about 10. he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion disgraceful.,0
uk troops on ivory coast standby downing street has confirmed british troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred uk citizens from ivory coast. the news came as it emerged france had begun evacuating its hostages after days of antifrench demonstrations. trouble flared after nine french peacekeepers were killed and president jacques chirac ordered the destruction of the ivory coast's air force. a company of 100120 uk troops is understood to have been put on standby. they are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. prime minister tony blair's official spokesman said there are british nationals in ivory coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further but that's all i can say at this stage. he added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. france has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in ivory coast  a former colony  after president laurent gbagbo broke an 18month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine french soldiers. the decision to destroy the african nation's small air force prompted riots against french and other foreign nationals. the spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.,0
csa 'could close' says minister ministers would not rule out scrapping the child support agency if it failed to improve work and pensions secretary alan johnson has warned. but he said replacing the controversial csa would be the nuclear option. a report by the commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. chairman sir archy kirkwood said if the agency cannot be rescued then it must be replaced. the committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250000 cases have yet to be processed. it warned that it could be five years before the csa was fit for purpose describing it as a failing organisation and in crisis with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. the report urged the csa to draw up contingency plans including the abandonment option to be presented to parliament by easter in case the cs2 computer system could not be made to work. and responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped mr johnson told bbc radio 4's today programme i certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. but i think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work. the mps launched their inquiry into the csa's performance after it became clear that despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003 a backlog of claims was building up. the mps found the 456m system from american it giant eds was nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate. faced with the committee's criticism the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency's staff by 25. the csa has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents. it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than 720m while a further 947m has been designated as unrecoverable. michelle a mother of twins said she had not received a penny of the 57 a week she should be receiving from her expartner and had faced an ongoing battle with the csa. her forms have twice been lost in the post she said. i don't receive correspondence i don't receive phone calls i have to chase them all the time she said. theresa may tory shadow work and pensions secretary said we have got to find a way that's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them. the agency's former chief executive doug smith quit last autumn claiming he was seriously disappointed with its performance. the committee said the national audit office should investigate why the eds system had gone so badly wrong. it blamed the agency's senior management for a multitude of problems within the agency including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff.,0

blair 'damaged' by blunkett row a majority of voters 68 believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over david blunkett's involvement in a visa application a poll suggests. but nearly half those surveyed said mr blunkett should return to cabinet if labour won the next election. some 63 of respondents in the sunday times poll thought his former lover  kimberly quinn  acted vindictively and 61 that he had been right to resign. yougov polled a weighted sample of 1981 voters online on 1618 december. mr blunkett resigned as home secretary on wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an email showing a visa application by mrs quinn's former nanny had been speeded up. sir alan budd's inquiry also found mr blunkett's account of events had been wrong. almost a quarter 21 of those polled for the sunday times said he should return to the cabinet straight after the election. one in four said he should be back in the government's top ranks within a year or two while 39 opposed a comeback. threequarters said mr blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see mrs quinn's son  whom he says he fathered  and just 14 voiced sympathy for mrs quinn. a total of 53 of those polled said they had sympathy for mr blunkett with 40 saying they did not. fortythree per cent thought mr blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17 disagreed. meantime 32 said mr blair was a good prime minister and 38 disagreed. a majority 52 said chancellor gordon brown had done a good job and just 16 disagreed. a second poll for the independent on sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the blunkett controversy. labour lead the conservatives by 39 to 34 with the liberal democrats on 19. communicateresearch interviewed 401 people before david blunkett's resignation and 601 afterwards. some 82 said mr blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his but 42 backed his legal action compared to 45 who thought it was unbecoming. thirty per cent said the affair showed mr blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63 disagreed.,0
guantanamo four questioned the four britons freed from us custody in guantanamo bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative. moazzam begg martin mubanga feroz abbasi and richard belmar were held for three years accused of alqaeda links. mr begg's father azmat said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was a hero. the men are being held at london's paddington green police station where they are expected to be questioned by uk antiterror officers. but louise christian the lawyer representing mr abbasi and mr mubanga said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. before being driven by police from birmingham to london azmat begg said he was concerned for his son moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. as azmat begg arrived at the london police station there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. police have said they have a duty to investigate the men who were arrested on their return to the uk. but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said evidence obtained by mi5 while the four were in cuba was absolutely inadmissible in uk courts. in an interview with the independent sir john said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the uk. he told the newspaper if an admission is made it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. the options are if there is enough evidence they will be charged. if not they will be released as soon as possible. the men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. louise christian said that after being tortured and abused at guantanamo bay the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. she told bbc news she remained very concerned about their psychological state. gareth peirce lawyer for mr begg said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. washington has claimed all four were enemy combatants who trained at camps run by alqaeda. the pentagon says they were freed after the uk government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the us or any of its allies. the detainees were immediately arrested under section 41 of the terrorism act 2000 when they landed at raf northolt west london on tuesday. massoud shadjareh from the muslim safety forum said what sort of homecoming is this they are innocent people. the muslim council of britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help. we want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family said iqbal sacranie secretary general of the council.,0
campbell lifts lid on united feud arsenal's sol campbell has called the rivalry between manchester united and the gunners bitter and personal. past encounters have stirred up plenty of illfeeling between the sides and they meet again at highbury on tuesday. it is just more bitter and personal against united the defender told the guardian newspaper. there's an edge. after all that has happened if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins especially because of how we lost to them up there. last october arsenal lost 20 at old trafford which ended a record 49match unbeaten league run and sparked a minicrisis with the gunners winning only three of their next 10 games. it had a psychological impact on us but again because of the way we were defeated added the 30yearold referring to a controversial penalty award for united's first goal. that was far more upsetting losing like that because they just seem to get away with it. you try and balance out over the course of a season but i've had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder. with tensions spilling over afterwards  united boss sir alex ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players' tunnel  there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. everyone at arsenal has been waiting for this game said campbell. we are up for this one. speaking on his longterm plans campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35. i'm 30 now and in five years' time i won't be in this country  that's definite. italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football. spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most. i'm starting a little with french of course.,1
seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently in the gulf of mexico is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric id cards the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. along with the owner's picture name and personal details the new seafarers' identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year in line with the revised un convention on seafarers' identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers produced by different companies in different countries are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities will be published by the international labour organisation ilo by the end of november. crystal cruises which operates the crystal harmony is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenticorp the us technology consultancy has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. if you're issued a seafarer's id in your country you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in say my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed authenticorp's ceo cynthia musselman told the bbc's go digital programme. she said french jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world said ms musselman. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are in fact seafarers.,2
latest opera browser gets vocal net browser opera 8.0 due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors. the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version. opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create style sheets its developers say. this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson. so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users. another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device. the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. our idea was to take a first step in making humancomputer interaction more natural said ms hanson. people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more handsfree experience. unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice. around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. the voice recognition function is currently only available in english. opera is free to download but a paidfor version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. opera began life as a research project  a spinoff from norwegian telecoms company telenor. its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.,2
blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of antiterror legislation. the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the antiterrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november. mr blair said the bill which brings in house arrest for terror suspects had time limiting safeguards already. the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. the lib dems also oppose the plans. the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases. mr blair's refusal to accept the tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords. peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday. the bill proposes control orders which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights. the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders not just house arrest. shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four's the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorists. he went on to say if we don't get the amendments we regard as essential including the sunset clause we will vote against the bill. in the commons mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through. mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. the second less stringent type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a threemonthly report on their use by an eminent and independent person. i believe the new powers are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk said mr blair. the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said there's a lot of talking left. i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months. a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a basic principle that people should only be punished after a fair trial. she added having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.,0
talks held on gibraltar's future two days of talks on the future of gibraltar begin at jack straw's country residence later on wednesday. officials at the twoday summit at the foreign secretary's official kent house chevening will plan a new forum on the rock's future. in october mr straw and his spanish counterpart miguel moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give gibraltarians a voice in their future. most gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain british. gibraltar's chief minister peter caruana will represent the british citizens living on the rock while britain's europe director dominick chilcott will represent the uk. madrid is being represented by spain's director general for europe jose maria pons. the initiative follows spain's socialist government's decision to put its longstanding sovereignty ambitions on hold. gibraltarians rejected plans for the rock's sovereignty to be shared between britain and spain in a referendum organised by gibraltar government.,0
mcilroy wins 800m indoor title james mcilroy motored to the aaa's indoor 800m title in sheffied on sunday in a time of one minute 47.97 seconds. the larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from welshman jimmy watkins in the final 100 metres. i had to go out and go through all the gears before the europeans and i won't run again until then said mcilroy. ''i though if i got lucky i'd get close to the british record but i blew up in the end.'' mcilroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his buildup for the european indoors at madrid on 46 march. meanwhile paul brizzel and anna boyle reached the semifinals of the 60m hurdles with boyle setting a season's best of 7.48. in the women's 60m final ailis mcsweeney broke michelle carroll's longstanding irish record by clocking 7.37 which left her in third place. david gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the european indoor championships by claiming an impressive 400m victory. gillick was more than halfasecond clear when taking gold in 46.45  .02 outside his personal best set in saturday's semifinals. the irishman is now the fastest european this season. derval o'rourke broke her own irish 60m hurdles record by clocking 8.06 which left her third behind new british record holder sarah claxton 7.96. james nolan 346.04 took second in the men's 1500m behind neil speaight 345.86 but the offaly man was outside the european indoor standard. colin costello was seventh in the 1500m final in 348.82. deirdre ryan was second in the women's high jump with a clearance of 1.87m while aoife byrne took silver in the 800m in a personal best of 206.73. lisburn's kelly mcneice reid 431.34 was seventh in the women's 1500m while gary murray 811.22 was 11th in the men's 3000m. meanwhile stephen cairns and jill shannon claimed the individual titles at saturday's northern ireland cross country championship in coleraine. cairns came in ahead of paul rowan and allan bogle in the men's race. willowfield claimed their first men's team title in 72 years while shannon helped lagan valley win the women's team honours.,1
mobiles 'not media players yet' mobiles are not yet ready to be allsinging alldancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players say two reports. despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said realtime tv broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in europe until 2007. technical issues and standards must be resolved first said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computerbased download services will put more demands on battery life. fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said thomas husson mobile analyst at jupiter research. mobile music services should be new and different and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches. other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading after the success of apple's itunes napster and other net music download services. with phones getting smarter and more powerful there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us services like tivo to go let people transfer prerecorded tv content onto their phones. but the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently tvlike services where clips are downloaded are offered by several european operators like italy's tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though said the report. various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004 the european telecommunications institute etsi formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld dvbh as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring realtime broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvbh standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too which expects good quality images at low prices according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens said gartner. digital video recorders like europe's sky box and videoondemand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii nokia 6600 sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200 offering web access text and multimedia messaging email calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instatmdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44 over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.,2
norway upholds 'napster' ruling a norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable mp3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country's supreme court. frank allan bruvik was ordered to pay 100000 kroner 8000 to the music industry in norway. he was a student when he set up his napster.no site which allowed users to submit and receive links to mp3 files. bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry. music industry bosses in norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium. frank allan bruvik set up the napster.no website as part of a school project in 2001 while studying computer engineering in the norwegian town of lillehammer. the website was not associated with the napster.com site in the usa which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action. bruvik's site was online between august and november 2001 and while it did not host any music at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers. as well as providing links the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors. a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norway's performing rights society tono and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music who saw it as an important test of principle. a norwegian court ruled in 2003 that bruvik would have to pay 100000 kroner to the music industry but the country's court of appeal cleared him saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. however the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act and that bruvik's actions were premeditated. norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling because showed that music piracy would not be accepted. meanwhile in the usa a further 717 lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the recording industry association of america. the suits brought on behalf of the major record companies cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peertopeer services such as kazaa and edonkey. as with preceding cases the fresh action was made against socalled john doe defendants who are identified only by the codes given to their computers' internet connections.,2
butler launches attack on blair former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair's government operates accusing it of being obsessed with headlines. he also attacked the way the iraq war was sold to the public with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the most damaging testimony he could remember. but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style. lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. the prime minister's official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. but he added you cannot in a modern government take every decision in cabinet. it's just not possible. lord butler said the government had too much freedom to bring in bad bills and to do whatever it likes and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments. mr howard described lord butler's intervention as very important. this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government. it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position. lord butler's report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government's september 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was very thin. the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war lord butler said in his spectator interview which was conducted by the magazine's editor conservative mp boris johnson. he said when civil servants give material to ministers they say these are the conclusions we've drawn but we've got to tell you the evidence we've got is pretty thin. similarly if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them. asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat. when asked whether he thought the country was wellgoverned on the whole he replied well. i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive and that is a very grave flaw. we should be breaking away from the party whip. the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes  and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. all that is part of what is bad government in this country. lord butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary lord armstrong. lord armstrong told bbc two's newsnight i agree ... there doesn't appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decisionmaking that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect. liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler's comments were well justified and mr blair's style of leadership was corrosive of the whole system of government. but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration when he was cabinet secretary. mr cunningham told bbc radio 4's today programme taken together robin butler's comments are partial inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government.,0
brentford v southampton griffin park tuesday 1 march 1945 gmt barry knight kent home to manchester united in the quarterfinals midfielder andrew frampton and striker deon burton are both slight doubts with hamstring injuries but should be fit saints are missing their entire firstchoice midfield of jamie redknapp graeme le saux nigel quashie and david prutton. anders svensson and matt oakley are likely replacements with kevin phillips also scheduled to start with henri camara rested.  brentford boss martin allen after conceding eight goals in our last three matches i have to admit i'm not very confident. there's no doubt we're the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it's not looking good. southampton have just drawn with the premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already.  southampton boss harry redknapp we know they can give us problems. brentford have done well but we are the premiership side and should have the better players. staying in the premiership is our priority. we want to win of course we do. we'll battle but if it comes to a football match i think we'll win. key match stats  brentford are the lowest ranked club left in the fa cup. they're on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarterfinals for the fourth time in their history 16 years ago. now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them. victory over premiership strugglers southampton would bring the mighty manchester united to griffin park and a gigantic pay day for the sole league one survivors.  martin allen's brave side came back from two goals down at st mary's to earn a deserved replay. southampton striker henri camara scored twice from close range to put the saints in command but isaiah rankin hit back just before half time and sam sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes.  the londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent league outings  three each in losing away to hartlepool and drawing at home to sheffield wednesday. but they haven't lost in six league and cup games on home turf  winning three and drawing three since the reverse to torquay on boxing day.  southampton go into this tie on the back of an eventful premiership match with arsenal on saturday. an angry david prutton pushed referee alan wiley after being shown the red card but his side still came back to draw 11. it was saints' fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions but didn't lift them out of the relegation zone. the retention of their ever present premier league status must be the number one priority irrespective of the rewards that success against brentford would bring.  victory here would set up a repeat of the 1976 final when saints astounded the football world by defeating tommy docherty's manchester united courtesy of bobby stokes' famous winner. they also knocked out the red devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round. but to write another chapter in their fa cup history the solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since rotherham from the second level beat them 21 in a third round tie at millmoor on 16 january 2002. southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago. fulham were then in the second division when they won a third round replay at craven cottage 10 on 13 january 1999.  to get to within two matches of a second visit to the millennium stadium in three years for the final harry redknapp must guide his side past a club 36 places inferior on the league ladder and a manager 19 years his junior who played under him at west ham. head to head 10th league one quarterfinals four times 18th prem winners once,1
intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light. scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. we've overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel's photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature dr paniccia  and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang  show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it. telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these lightmoving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in highvolume manufacturing have been solved. we're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easytomake filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semiconductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. it's a technical validation that it can work he said.,2
mcilroy continues winning streak james mcilroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week claiming the men's 800m at the teag indoor meeting in erfurt. the northern ireland runner set a new personal best of one minute 46.68 seconds  a time good enough to qualify for the european indoor championships. i'm qualified now and that's what matters most said the 28yearold. mcilroy is now hoping to gain a late entry into sunday's international indoor meeting in leipzig. the northern irishman is hoping manager ricky simms can swing it for him to compete after he initially withdrew after contracting a cold. after three successive wins over the past fortnight mcilroy is brimming with confidence. i've been waiting over six years for this to happen and now i'm certain my career has turned the corner. on friday mcilroy delivered an impressive run despite suffering from his bad cold. the aaa indoor and outdoor champion accelerated away from the field in the final 300m beating german wolfram mulle by 0.90 seconds. mcilroy set a worldleading mark for 1000m at the sparkassen cup in stuttgart last weekend. and his time in erfurt makes him third fastest over 800m in the world this year.,1
man city 02 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead. seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance  a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wrightphillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems. wes brown also found wrightphillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wrightphillips' sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pinpoint centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by sidefooting the easy chance wide. john o'shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some muchneeded pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne  but that was all about to change. after the break united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city's best firsthalf chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it  even if he needed the help of dunne's leg. worse was to come for dunne who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney's cross and united seemed home and dry. however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.  manchester city boss kevin keegan we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial. we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much. but we still had four good chances two after we'd gone 20 down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.  manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it wasn't our best performance of the last three months but i think we're deserved winners. at times especially in the first half we didn't play with enough speed. but with cristiano ronaldo and ryan giggs on the speed improved. derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that. man city james mills bradley wrightphillips 83 dunne distin thatcher shaun wrightphillips barton macken 68 sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler. subs not used weaver onuoha flood. booked fowler sibierski. man utd carroll gary neville ferdinand brown heinze o'shea ronaldo 33 keane fortune fletcher giggs 64 rooney scholes phil neville 84. subs not used howard bellion. booked rooney scholes keane. goals rooney 68 dunne 75 og. att 47111 ref s bennett kent.,1
games 'deserve a place in class' computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers. academics from the institute of education at london university found that games literacy was a key skill for youngsters. as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say. pupils should also be able to create their own games they say. like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives said project manager caroline pelletier. games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing she said. the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. researchers found that girls were often excluded from the maledominated world of game playing. without firsthand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity said research fellow diane carr. the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. sixthform teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film tv and popular music at the alevel course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge. for parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy. dr andrew burn associate director of the institute of education's centre for the study of children youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents. games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do he said. but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games. the games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. at a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently said roger bennett director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association. this report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming. they have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career. the threeyear research project which is being presented at a seminar on tuesday in london was partly funded by the department of trade and industry.,2
blair sets date for africa report the commission for africa's report will be released on 11 march  comic relief day tony blair has said. july's g8 summit in gleneagles in perthshire  chaired by the prime minister  will use the report as the basis for talks on africa. the announcement followed the final meeting of the commission  which includes singer bob geldof  in london. as well as more aid fairer trade and less debt the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in africa. mr blair told a news conference it will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality but i hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. it's an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it. mr blair has vowed to put africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the g8. he acknowledged he would have a a job of persuading to do on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief. bob geldof in characteristically blunt style promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for africa. the former rock star's presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands. the people involved include two african government leaders and a range of other african politicians as well as experts from some other developed countries.,0
mourinho expects fight to finish chelsea manager jose mourinho expects the champions league clash with barcelona to be a fight to the finish. mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last 16 in the nou camp. he said i wouldn't be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time. i have to defend what is mine and the champions league is mine at the moment. i'm the last manager to have won it. mourinho never coached barcelona assisting both sir bobby robson and louis van gaal. but he is not envious insisting i don't have to be jealous about barcelona because they have 100 years of history and have won the european cup once. i have been managing for five years and i have the same amount of champions league trophies to my name. barcelona star ronaldinho admitted i think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because chelsea have a good team full of big stars. i have seen chelsea a few times on television tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counterattack. they pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game. i believe they are the two strongest teams in europe. nevertheless barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the nou camp where they have to face the likes of real madrid each season. it is a special game the atmosphere in the city changes there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference ronaldinho added. we are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition.,1
eu referendum question unveiled the question to be asked in the referendum on the eu constitution has been unveiled by the government. it will be should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum expected in 2006. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25state eu. if we reject this treaty britain will be isolated and weak in europe said foreign secretary jack straw who along with the rest of the cabinet will back a yes vote. patriots by definition wanted the uk to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad mr straw said. our role as a leading member of the eu is a crucial part of securing that. conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question seems straightforward. but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution when they should be treated as two separate issues. despite this underhand trick the referendum bill stood no chance of becoming law before the election he added. this is tony blair's cheap gesture to the proconstitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win. neil o'brien director of anticonstitution group vote no said the reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business. the uk independence party said if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu. then we can be out of it and better off much sooner. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy who backs the constitution said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. he told bbc radio 4's today programme the sooner we get on with this the better. he said the question sounded very neutral and balanced adding it would enable the argument to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides. green mep caroline lucas welcomed tony blair's courage in keeping his word on holding a referendum. but she added this treaty is a flawed document that will make the eu less accountable less sustainable and less just. mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. that promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. jack straw who argues the constitution reflected a british vision for europe and gives national governments a stronger grip has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. but in an interview with the financial times mr blair refused to be pinned down to that date saying britain would hold a poll some time in 2006 but when i don't know. the paper said the prime minister claimed ignorance of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.,0
plaid mp's cottage arson claim a plaid cymru mp believes uk security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on welsh extremists. it is 25 years since the start of 12 years of firebombings attributed to a shadowy group known as meibion glyndwr. plaid cymru's elfyn llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote. exwelsh office minister lord roberts of conwy denied security services were involved. in march this year north wales police reopened the case saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield dna evidence. meibion glyndwr  which means sons of glyndwr  began burning property in december 1979 in protest at homes in rural wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from england. the group was linked to most of the 220 or so firebombing incidents stretching from the llyn peninsula to pembrokeshire. the campaign continued until the early 1990s. police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist. although one man sion aubrey roberts was convicted in 1993 of sending letter bombs in the post the arson cases remain unsolved. as a solicitor elfyn llwyd represented welsh singer bryn f244n when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign. f244n was released without charge . but now as mp for merionnydd nant conwy and plaid cymru's parliamentary leader mr llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not meibion glyndwr. he believes that elements of the british security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit plaid cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections. the claim is made in an interview for bbc wales' maniffesto programme to be shown on s4c on sunday. mr llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing. he said what i'm saying is that the role that they took wasn't the appropriate one i.e. like an agent provocateur and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible. the programme also heard from lord roberts of conwy who was a welsh office minister at the time. he denied that the security services played any improper role. mr llwyd's theory has also been questioned by plaid cymru's former president dafydd wigley. he accepted that the fires damaged plaid cymru's public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the ira and animal rights activists.  maniffesto can be seen on s4c on sunday 12 december at 1200 gmt.,0
bt boosts its broadband packages british telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers. the increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider aol. many bt customers will now have download speeds of 2mbps although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. the new speeds start to come into effect on 17 february for home customers and 1 april for businesses. britain is now broadband britain said duncan ingram bt's managing director broadband and internet services. he added ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed. these speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections he said. upload speeds  the speed at which information is sent from a pc via broadband  will remain at the same speed said mr ingram. despite the increases bt will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. the allowances are extremely generous said mr ingram for what we are seeing in the market place  they are really not an issue. bt will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. bt now has a 36 share of the broadband market  down from 39  which is becoming increasingly competitive. in the last few months many rival isps have begun to offer 2mbps services including aol plusnet and uk online. but britain continues to lag behind some countries  especially japan and south korea  which offer broadband speeds of up to 40mbps. but mr ingram said it was important to separate hype from reality. he said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40mbps. customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 february. mr ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems.,2
collins to compete in birmingham world and commonwealth 100m champion kim collins will compete in the 60m at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on 18 february. the st kitts and nevis star joins british olympic relay gold medallists jason gardener and mark lewisfrancis. sydney olympic 100m champion and world indoor record holder maurice greene and athens olympic 100m silver medallist francis obikwelu will also take part. collins ran in birmingham at the 2003 world indoor championships. i'm looking forward to competing against such a strong field he said. i got a great reception form the crowd at the nia when i won my 60m world indoor silver medal in 2003 and it will be really exciting to return to this venue. the world champion says he's in good shape but he isn't underestimating the home competition. jason gardener and mark lewisfrancis are olympic gold medallists now and i'm sure they'll be aiming to win in front of their home supporters. i'm looking forward to competing against britain's best sprinters and i'm sure the 60 metres will be one of the most exciting races of the evening. collins was sixth in the olympic final in athens but is hoping for a better result at the world championships in finland this summer. this will be a big year for me and i plan to defend my 100m world title in helsinki in august. before then i want to perform well over 60m indoors and start my year in winning form.,1
athens memories soar above lows well it's goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens. obviously there's no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember  or forget  for athletics. one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly's success in the 800m. winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of should i shouldn't i thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn't you do the 800m it's your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story. the victory for the british men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them  jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis  knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. hicham el guerrouj's olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly's on a global scale. he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5000m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good. what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day. things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula's olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people  including me. purely as a race paula's victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nipandtuck between her and kenya's susan chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability. and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. kelly and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level. the only individual men's finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that's where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond. i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. to be honest i'm getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on. having said that i'm always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.,1
mcconnell details scots wave toll at least three people from scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list the first minister has told msps. the figures came out during a statement by jack mcconnell to the scottish parliament on wednesday. he formally expressed scotland's sympathy for the victims of the indian ocean tidal wave which killed 150000. mr mcconnell went on to promise that scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort. he said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police. mr mcconnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. he said he was proud of the generous response of people in scotland to the disaster appeal which is expected soon to top 20m. the first minister also praised scottish water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone. the scottish executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies. but he said scotland was in it for the long term with help planned for fishing communities for children's services and for the aid charities. he said 2005 must be the year that scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world whether in asia or in africa. mr mcconnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the make poverty history campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities trade unions and churches in the runup to the g8 summit in gleneagles in july. edinburgh architect dominic stephenson became the first scot to be confirmed as a victim of the asian tsunami. the 27yearold was holidaying on the thai island of koh phi phi with eileen lee 24. she is still missing.,0
hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break  but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite's bid for champions league glory. hodgson  now in charge at viking stavanger  was at liverpool's clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa's technical committee. hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england  where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league. i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge. i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league. the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february. hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages explaining as i said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries. and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction. in preseason you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot find themselves getting very jaded. the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. the mental side is by far the most important thing. hodgson added the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year. it was so short you didn't do anything. you gave the players a week or 10 days off then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game. if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them. and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then i would support a winter break. if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then a break would do them the world of good  physically and mentally.,1
finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals. after saturday's superb display in the draw in paris ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday. the versatile finnan who starred against the french is confident the group is ireland's for the taking. there is a chance for us now to go on win our home games and why not win the group even though it's a tough one said the liverpool player. switzerland ireland france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches  although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris. in basel we did not play great football but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game. in paris we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances. looking back we had an opportunity to get the three points but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday's game. on paper we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves. automatic qualification is there. it would certainly be good to avoid a playoff but on the back of a couple of good results i don't see why we can't win the group. manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on ireland's right flank at the stade de france. finnan's normal position is rightback but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the french. as i play on the right for my club and being a natural rightback it was something he kerr looked at because france play strongly down the lefthand side. so i was happy to play and stephen carr and i enjoyed the game particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks.,1
blair told to double overseas aid tony blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid. some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels oxfam says in a report paying the price. the call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the g8 of top industrialised nations. as rich countries get richer they're giving less and less. this scandal must stop oxfam's barbara stocking said. the world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives. 2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure the charity's director added. the report said for rich countries providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice not an act of charity. it also points out that in 1970 the g8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7 of their incomes on aid. but 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable the report says. it argues that the price of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development will be felt across the world. the report said global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. environmental crises and natural disasters disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. new threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak. both the prime minister and chancellor gordon brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. mr blair who has described africa as a scar on the world's conscience has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. mr brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to britain by the world's poor nations. a spokeswoman for the department for international development said the government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7 of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. if britain's proposal for an international finance facility were adopted the objective of 0.7 could be achieved earlier by 200809. these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least 1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least 1.5bn on hivaids related work over the next three years.,0
dozens held over id fraud site twentyeight people including a briton have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud. those arrested are accused of operating shadowcrew.com which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud. a 19yearold man from camberley surrey was arrested by the national hitech crime unit but has been bailed. operation firewall led by the us secret service involved seven nations. the british teenager was arrested on wednesday but details only emerged on friday. he has now been bailed to return to a surrey police station in december. all 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internetbased network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. the authorities in the us who have indicted 19 people in newark new jersey estimate the fraud caused losses of more than 4m. assistant us attorney scott christie said several people had been arrested in argentina bulgaria canada estonia poland and sweden. mr christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a russian anatoly tyukanov. investigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites  shadowcrew carderplanet and darkprofits. the us secret service was first tipped off in july 2003. an nhtcu spokeswoman said the american investigators went undercover on the shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site's 4000 members were using it for organised crime purposes. she said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards driver's licences passports and birth certificates. the websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime she said. the shadowcrew site which has now been taken over by the us secret service listed several discussion groups in english and russian including one on hacking spam and online anonymity tools. the head of the nhtcu acting detective chief superintendent mick deats said this investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit. we believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions. chief supt deats went on to warn the internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain. your identity is one of the most precious commodities. criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in ecommerce will be targeted by law enforcement.,2
royal couple watch nation's mood prince charles and camilla parker bowles are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 april. mrs parker bowles will take the title hrh duchess of cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at windsor castle. a daily telegraph poll of 1313 people suggests twothirds of britons support the couple's decision to marry. but only 40 think mrs parker bowles should become princess consort as planned after charles becomes king. some 47 believe she should have no title while 7 think she should become queen. the poll also found that the majority of britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation with the queen handing the throne to her grandson prince william 22 on her death or abdication. on thursday night prince charles 56 and mrs parker bowles 57 hosted a dinner at windsor castle their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. mrs parker bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added i'm just coming down to earth. she displayed her diamond engagement ring  a royal family heirloom  to reporters. charles said he and his wifetobe were absolutely delighted. their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970. the queen and duke of edinburgh said the news had made them very happy. princes william and harry said they are very happy and wish the couple all the luck in the future. the wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in st george's chapel at which the archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams will preside. the marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because mrs parker bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. if he became king charles would be the supreme governor of the church of england and some anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. his divorce from diana and the disappointment the country felt over how diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with prince charles said ros coward who wrote the authorised biography of diana princess of wales. the archbishop of canterbury said i am pleased that prince charles and mrs camilla parker bowles have decided to take this important step. tony blair said he was delighted for the couple and offered his congratulations as did conservative leader michael howard and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy. australia's prime minister john howard also offered his congratulations adding that their decision to marry was a sensible and a good thing. mrs parker bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years  mostly at evening events for the prince's trust. clarence house staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.,0
us blogger fired by her airline a us airline attendant suspended over inappropriate images on her blog  web diary  says she has been fired. ellen simonetti known as queen of the sky wrote an anonymous semifictional account of her life in the sky. she was suspended by delta in september. in a statement she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for wrongful termination. a delta spokesperson confirmed on wednesday that ms simonetti was no longer an employee. delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls internal employee matters. a spokesperson reiterated this position on wednesday confirming only that ms simonetti was no longer with the company. the spokesperson also confirmed that there were very clear rules attached to the unauthorised use of delta branding including uniforms. ms simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 november. she said in an official statement as a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by delta airlines i am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the federal government eeoc us equal employment opportunity commission. she added she had also hired a texasbased law firm to initiate legal action for wrongful termination defamation of character and lost future wages. ms simonetti told the bbc news website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 september. queen of the sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the bbc news website and others. her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites. the blog which she started in january as a way of getting over her mother's death contains a mix of fictional and nonfictional accounts. queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti. in the postings she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity. but some postings contained images of herself in uniform. of the 10 or so images only one showed ms simonetti's flight wings. she removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. i never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said. a legal expert in the us speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted. delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition. it has said it needs to cut between 6000 and 7000 jobs and reduce costs by 5bn 2.7bn a year. analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention. last week it struck a 1bn costcutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy. the deal would see pilots accept a 32 pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million delta shares unions said. and on monday it negotiated a deal to defer about 135m in debt which was due next year until 2007. the airline also said it had agreed the terms of a 600m loan from american express.,2
malik rejects allblack mp lists a call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and asian mps has been rejected by one of labour's most senior asians. shahid malik who is on labour's ruling nec accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. just 13 of britain's 659 mps are from ethnic minority groups he added. commission for racial equality chief trevor phillips argued on sunday the time had come for such shortlists. that came after it emerged that one of britain's most ethnically diverse constituency west ham was to get a womenonly shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling. mr phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for underrepresented groups. for example in west ham this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this we cannot go on the same way he said. he added it would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency west ham in the whole of europe we didn't have a minority candidate. appearing on bbc radio 4's today programme mr malik who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury acknowledged that so far womenonly shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates. but he argued i do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective. labour mp diane abbot who backs mr phillips' proposal of shortlists said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps  keith vaz paul boateng and bernie grant  in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. that was a rate of progress ms abbott described as painful. i am a little older than shahid and served on the national executive committee in the 1990s  i was the first black person on the nec ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and asian mp hasn't worked she said. the shortlist strategy works for women and i believe that it can be made to work for black and asian people. on tuesday labour chairman ian mccartney said his party was ambitious to improve black and asian representation. we haven't ruled out allblack shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this he said.,0

jowell rejects 'las vegas' jibe the secretary of state for culture media and sport tessa jowell has hit out at critics of the gambling bill. she told the guardian newspaper there would be no las vegasstyle supercasinos as rumoured in the press. meanwhile labour backbencher stephen pound labelled casinorelated regeneration schemes a pile of pants. the mp for ealing north claimed the legislation would encourage a mafialike culture of vice and corruption in an interview on bbc radio 4. you look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate blackpool. they are in it to fill their boots mr pound told the today programme. i just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. and over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalkstripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti he said. ms jowell complained of the scale of misrepresentation in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper her first since the bill was launched. the culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to protect children and the vulnerable in a swiftly changing sector. ms jowell insisted we have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country for instance in social housing. and continued we can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. i intend to keep it that way. ms jowell will set out her position when the bill is debated in the commons on monday. in prime minister's questions last week tony blair assured parliament that 90 of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.,0
iaaf awaits greek pair's response kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the international association of athletics federations iaaf. the greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in tel aviv chicago and athens. they have until midnight on 16 december and an iaaf spokesman said we're sure their responses are on their way. if they do not respond or their explanations are rejected they will be provisionally banned from competition. they will then face a hearing in front of the greek federation which will ultimately determine their fate. their former coach christos tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. under iaaf rules the athletes could receive a maximum oneyear suspension. kenteris and thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash. no date for the trial has yet been set and again tzekos is also facing charges. the iaaf issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete where they had said they would be. all athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times so they can be available for outofcompetition drugs tests. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago when they decided to fly back to greece early. then just before the olympics the pair dramatically missed another test in athens and withdrew from the games.,1
strike threat over pension plans millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer warn union leaders. the cabinet office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. they believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made. it is thought the proposed overhaul due on thursday could mean pensions could be based on a career average salary. for each year served staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the leadup to the next general election which is widely expected next may. in a statement on sunday the cabinet office said it was reviewing the civil service pension scheme and hoped to announce proposals soon. unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. people are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. to maintain the longterm affordability of our pension scheme the government announced in its green paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65. on monday tony blair's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. he said what's important is that there's a process going on it's out for consultation at the moment let's wait for that process to complete itself. there is already widespread anger over the chancellor's plans to get rid of more than 100000 civil servants. now public service unions are united against the plans and the trades union congress is discussing the issue next monday. dave prentis general secretary of unison said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. members working in the nhs or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses but they could look forward to a decent pension  now all that is being taken away he said. what really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of mps who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in europe but say they can't afford it for anyone else. this is a position that unison cannot accept and will oppose. it will lead to conflict between unison and the government if not this year then next. mr prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. mark serwotka from the public and commercial services union said there should be a coordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. the fire brigades union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. pensions officer paul woolstenholmes said the pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat  apart from mps and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.,0
kenyon denies robben barca return chelsea chief executive peter kenyon has played down reports that arjen robben will return for the champions league match against barcelona. he's been responding well to treatment and started running on friday but we'll have to wait and see he told bbc five live's sportsweek. we're looking to getting him back as soon as possible but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. there's no plans at the moment around the barcelona game. his comments contradict those of chiropractor jean pierre meersseman who treated the dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of february. robben had been expected to be out for six weeks but meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital stamford bridge game on 8 march. i hope he can be back and i will try to help him make that happen meersseman told the mail on sunday. i put everything right with arjen's foot the last time i saw him 12 days ago. it was an obvious correction and easy to perform. i know he was pleased with what i did and now that he is running again. i am due to see him one more time again in the next few days. meersseman is the medical coordinator at italian side ac milan.,1
boothroyd calls for lords speaker betty boothroyd has said the house of lords needs its own speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber. baroness boothroyd who was the first woman to be commons speaker said she believed tony blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it she told the bbc's breakfast with frost. in 1999 labour removed all but 92 of the lords' 750 hereditary peers. that was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution. the lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next labour manifesto. i think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the lords and the commons lord falconer told bbc1's breakfast with frost. how it interacts with the commons is a very very important issue. we need to address the issue in the manifesto but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes. the lord chancellor currently has the role of house of lords speaker. he is also head of the judiciary and a member of the cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary. lady boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of speaker. i would really like to see a speaker of the house of lords she said. i don't go for the idea of somebody  a lord chancellor  who is head of the judiciary a senior cabinet minister and speaker of the lords. i want somebody there who is going to look after that house and do a job there.,0

stam spices up man utd encounter ac milan defender jaap stam says manchester united know they made a mistake by selling him in 2001. the sides meet at old trafford in the champions league game on wednesday and the 32yearold's dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. united made a mistake in selling me stam told uefa's champions magazine. i was settled at manchester united but they wanted to sell me. if a club want to sell you there is nothing you can do. you can be sold like cattle. sir alex ferguson surprised the football world  and stam  by selling the dutchman to lazio for 16.5m in august 2001. the decision came shortly after stam claimed in his autobiography that ferguson had tapped him up when he was at psv eindhoven. but ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. the affair still rankles with the dutchman. i was settled at manchester united i had even just ordered a new kitchen but they wanted to sell me he said. in what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes of course you can refuse to go but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. i don't agree that players control the game. there have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers but i have turned them down. what's the point wednesday's game at old trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between united's young attackers wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo and milan's veteran defence of stam paolo maldini cafu and alessandro costacurta. stam says rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. we can't all be wayne rooneys  at his age i was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone he said. starting late can be a good thing. some kids who start early get bored. i had my youth  having fun drinking beers blowing up milk cannisters. it sounds strange but it's a tradition where i grew up in kampen  and i had done all the things i wanted to do.,1
ministers lose slopping out case the scottish executive has lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison. armed robber robert napier 25 won 2450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint eczema when slopping out at barlinnie prison. napier said that the practice where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets breached his human rights. on thursday the court of session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof. the executive faces more than 1000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates. more than 310 actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland. an executive spokesman said we will study this judgement in detail. much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case for example slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated. today's judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases. napier a remand prisoner at the time raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the european convention on human rights in which he sought 5000. he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case. executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt. this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland. however civil litigation is settled on the test of a balance of probabilities. judge lord cullen sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. napier's lawyer tony kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others. mr kelly said there are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today's judgement. scottish national party justice minister kenny macaskill said that the slopping out case had been a fiasco from start to finish. he said ministers were fully aware of the state of scotland's jails. funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling i suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts. a short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost.,0
man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarterfinals. rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes' freekick. marcus bent missed everton's best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet. rooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kickoff. and rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19yearold. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goalline. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes rising to meet ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clearcut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before halftime. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton's rescue three minutes later when rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes' freekick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily. everton's problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injurytime when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker.  manchester united coach sir alex ferguson it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he's persistent and never gives in. i don't know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again he's truly a fabulous player. everton martyn hibbert yobo stubbs naysmith osman carsley arteta kilbane mcfadden bent. subs wright pistone weir plessis vaughan. manchester united carroll gary neville brown ferdinand heinze ronaldo phil neville keane scholes fortune rooney. subs howard giggs smith miller spector. referee r styles hampshire,1

mourinho receives robson warning sir bobby robson has offered chelsea boss jose mourinho some advice on coping under pressure. the pair worked together at barcelona and porto and robson had a word of warning for his protege. it has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose said robson. it is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn and he'll get it straight. robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of newcastle. jose is doing very well at the moment robson added of the man who worked for him for six years. he has got one pot  possibly two to follow  a big game against barcelona to come and i cannot see them losing their lead in the premiership. they are in a good position and i would expect them to go on and win it which is a wonderful achievement. what has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future. if he is intelligent he will take it on board  and he is very intelligent. he will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months. before that it was all about winning. robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against mourinho. i am not in a hurry to take the wrong job but i am ready to take the right job and i feel there is another job in me he added. i know the area i am capable of working in and of course i would like a job in the premiership if one was available. it would not worry me if i had to pit my wits against jose. but it is not just a case of him and me against one another. it would be his team against my team  but i would not be afraid of that.,1
fox attacks blair's tory 'lies' tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign say the tories. tory cochairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda. dr fox told bbc radio if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all. he would not discuss reports the party repaid 500000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. the prime minister ratcheted up labour's preelection campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date but it is widely expected to be 5 may. in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday mr blair said i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street. he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric then struggling to live up to the expectations and reaching the point of raised voices and throwing crockery. he warned his supporters against complacency saying it's a fight for the future of our country it's a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win. mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy it would result in a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward. dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies. what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear he told bbc news. the tory cochairman attacked labour's six new pledges as vacuous and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid 500000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters he said insisting he enjoyed a warm and constructive relationship to lord ashcroft. meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay. he said this is threeparty politics. in the northern cities the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats. in southern and rural seats  especially in the south west  the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives who are out of the running in scotland and wales. the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a touchyfeely speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.,0
progress on new internet domains by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names. the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an antispam domain and one for the catalan language and culture. the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help coordinate the ecommerce efforts of national post offices. the .travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new yorkbased trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new socalled top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.,2
trial date is set for balco case a us judge has set a preliminary trial date for the balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics. us district court judge susan ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pretrial hearing in san francisco. and she set a march date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performanceenhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard. a firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in january. the judge said that she may conduct hearings in january into whether federal agents illegally searched the balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company's founder victor conte and its vicepresident james valente. the two men  along with personal trainer greg anderson and athletics coach remy korchemny  were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence. the outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed. conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an american tv show on friday. the world deserves to know the truth about performanceenhancing drugs he said. balco the bay area laboratory cooperative is the company at the centre of the scandal. the company has been accused by the united states antidoping agency usada of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil. the usada claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for thg and modafinil. former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain's former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a twoyear ban after testing positive for thg in an outofcompetition test in 2003.,1
running around the olympics it was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to london's 2012 olympic bid. but i still managed to do all my marathon training. all the sporting people on the capital's bid team think i'm mad to be taking part in the london marathon. the bid chairman lord coe admitted he would never dream of running a marathon even though he was an olympic middledistance runner. kelly holmes former hurdler alan pascoe and former sprinter frankie fredericks  who is now an ioc member  all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. you'd have thought all these athletes who have been running for most of their lives wouldn't think it would be that bad. but the only person who was positive about my intentions was tanni grey thompson who has won the london marathon wheelchair race six times. even though it was a very busy week entertaining the international olympic committee's ioc evaluation commission i actually found my running schedule easier to follow. when i'm at home i get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days i was in london i was in a pressurised situation but i found it easy to relax by running. on wednesday the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening so i just managed to squeeze in a 45minute run. we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london that was pretty shattering but when we got back to the hotel i got back on the treadmill. on friday evening i went along to the special dinner at buckingham palace which was a nice occasion. i never feel guilty about eating especially when i'm exercising. and because it was a rest day i didn't have to feel bad about missing my training either. anyway i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations before heading home for my daughter's birthday. when i was in london i did all of my runs on the treadmill which isn't the same as exercising outdoors. one of the ioc's technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day. we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. i do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. but when you're gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday. after the week i'd had i was a bit concerned i wouldn't be able to complete it. but i coped with it very well and even though it was bitterly cold i put in 15andahalf miles  only another 11 to go then.  this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the bbc sport website.he will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of children's hospices the children with leukaemia charity and the trust's own project which aims to provide innercity schools with rowing equipment.,1

hansen 'delays return until 2006' british triple jumper ashia hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury according to reports. hansen the commonwealth and european champion has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june 2004. it was hoped she would be able to return this summer but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. her coach aston moore told the times we're not looking at any sooner than 2006 not as a triple jumper. moore said hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner but there is no shortterm prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event. there was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months but that has been solved and we can push ahead now he said. the aim is for her to get fit as an athlete  then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena. moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to toplevel competition though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march when she will be 34. it's been a frustrating time for her but it has not fazed her determination he added.,1
thompson says gerrard should stay liverpool legend phil thompson has pleaded with steve gerrard to reject any overtures from chelsea. the exreds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. he told bbc radio five live liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to steve in the end. but it wouldn't have that same sweet feeling at chelsea where it's all moneyorientated and about simply buying the best. thompson reacted sharply to some liverpool supporters who criticised gerrard's performance in the carling cup final against chelsea. a number of fans questioned gerrard's commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in liverpool's 32 defeat as his first goal for chelsea. thompson added i heard those comments from socalled supporters and they were diabolical absolutely outrageous. stevie carried the club last year and this year. he's always put liverpool first. thompson who savoured seven titlewinning seasons and two european cup triumphs during his anfield playing career is confident that the lure of champions league football will keep gerrard at anfield. i hope champions league football will beckon for liverpool  either as winners or as finishing fourth in the premiership  and he will commit himself. there has been a lot of soulsearching the way things have gone lately. i hope he's hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but i hope it is to the benefit of steven gerrard and i hope it is worthwhile for liverpool.,1
blog reading explodes in america americans are becoming avid blog readers with 32 million getting hooked in 2004 according to new research. the survey conducted by the pew internet and american life project showed that blog readership has shot up by 58 in the last year. some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the us presidential campaign. despite the explosive growth more than 60 of online americans have still never heard of blogs the survey found. blogs or web logs are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts opinions or spread news events in their own words. companies such as google and microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs. the rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information with six million americans now using rss aggregators. rss aggregators are downloaded to pcs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs news sites and other websites. the aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them the survey found. only 7 of the 120 million us adults who use the internet had created a blog or webbased diary. getting involved is becoming more popular though with 12 saying they had posted material or comments on other people's blogs. just under one in 10 of the us's internet users read political blogs such as the daily kos or instapundit during the us presidential campaign. kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than bush voters. blog creators were likely to be young welleducated netsavvy males with good incomes and college educations the survey found. this was also true of the average blog reader although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. the survey was conducted during november and involved telephone surveys of 1324 internet users.,2
campbell email row 'silly fuss' exno 10 media chief alastair campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an email containing a fourletter outburst aimed at bbc journalists. mr campbell sent the missive by mistake to bbc2's newsnight after it sought to question his role in labour's controversial poster campaign. he later contacted the show saying the original email had been sent in error and that it was all a silly fuss. mr campbell has recently rejoined labour's election campaign. the email was revealed the day after peter mandelson former labour minister and now a european commissioner warned the bbc to steer away from demonising mr campbell. mr campbell messaged newsnight after the programme investigated claims that labour's advertising agency tbwa was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. the images including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted tory leader michael howard as fagin prompted accusations of antisemitism claims denied by labour. mr campbell's email which was apparently intended for a party official suggested they should get trevor beattie tbwa's boss to issue a statement. in it he said just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. now fuck off and cover something important you twats the email was sent by mistake to newsnight journalist andrew mcfadyen. realising his error mr campbell then emailed mr mcfadyen pointing out the mistake but suggesting presenter jeremy paxman would have seen the funny side. he said not very good at this email blackberry malarkey. just looked at log of sent messages have realised email meant for colleagues at tbwa has gone to you. for the record first three sentences of email spot on. no row between me and trevor. posters done by them according to our brief. i dreamt up flying pigs. pigs not great but okay in the circs of tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. tbwa made production. campbell swears shock. final sentence of earlier email probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but i'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter mr p. never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. must look forward not back. later the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on mr campbell's use of abusive language. the spokesman said the person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government. foreign secretary jack straw said he had always had very good and polite relations with mr campbell who he described as very talented. but on the former spin doctor's use of language mr straw said i do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. maybe i mix with the wrong kind of journalists. liam fox tory cochairman said the return of mr campbell was a sign of new sinister and underhand tactics by labour.,0
asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania. the trial scheme which could start in weeks may be extended to apply to children from other countries. children's charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities. the pilot included in the government's fiveyear immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylumseeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims. since 2002 at least 9000 under18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanianborn teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families should they be traced or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country. under the 1989 children act public bodies have a duty to act in the best interest of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns not least because of the welldocumented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania. if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis she said. we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania. 'if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision. in its fiveyear immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot. we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylumseeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman. we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longerterm care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable. we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with children's legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities. the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said. but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg. in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries. a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.,0
hatfield executives go on trial engineering firm balfour beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the hatfield rail crash in 2000. four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed. balfour beatty's railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at hatfield hertfordshire. balfour beatty managers anthony walker and nicholas jeffries and railtrack managers alistair cook sean fugill and keith lea all face individual charges. all five men along with four others are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. balfour beatty rail maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. it is expected the trial could last as long as a year. the accident on 17 october 2000 happened when the london to leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. the accident on the east coast main line sparked major disruption. the overall responsibility for the line was railtrack's  the company that has now become network rail. those who died in the accident were steve arthur 46 from pease pottage west sussex peter monkhouse 50 of headingley leeds leslie gray 43 of tuxford nottingham and robert james alcorn 37 of auckland new zealand.,0
edwards tips idowu for euro gold world outdoor triple jump record holder and bbc pundit jonathan edwards believes phillips idowu can take gold at the european indoor championships. idowu landed 17.30m at the british trials in sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. it's all down to him but if he jumps as well as he did in sheffield he could win the gold medal said edwards. his ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings. idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a commonwealth silver medal to his name. edwards himself kept idowu off top spot at the manchester games. but he believes the european indoors in madrid represent a chance for the 26yearold to prove his credentials as britain's top triple jumper. he has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning said edwards. phillips still needs to be much more consistent. i'm sure a victory in madrid will build up his confidence and selfbelief that he can be best in the world. the qualifying round of the men's triple jump in madrid takes place on friday with the final scheduled for saturday. olympic champion christian olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.,1
kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get uptodate information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the nongovernmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called eslates. the eslates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals. the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld eslates. it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc. the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. it's very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it's also a oneway connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult. the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linuxbased system. the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other. eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. all books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the eslates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working. maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the eslates says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting  as they need it most.,2
watchdog probes email deletions the information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of cabinet office orders telling staff to delete emails more than three months old. richard thomas totally condemned the deletion of emails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january. government guidance said emails should only be deleted if they served no current purpose mr thomas said. the tories and the lib dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. tory leader michael howard has written to tony blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on email retention. on monday lib dem constitutional affairs committee chairman alan beith warned that the deletion of millions of government emails could harm the ability of key probes like the hutton inquiry. the timing of the new rules just before the freedom of information act comes into forces was too unlikely to have been a coincidence mr beith said. but a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records. mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the email regime could support the freedom of information regime. mr thomas said the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence. he said there was already clear guidance on the retention of emails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. all emails are subject to the freedom of information laws but the important thing was the content of the email said mr thomas. if in doubt retain that has been the longstanding principle of the civil service and public authorities. it's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. but any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned. the freedom of information act will cover england wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100000 public bodies subject to various exemptions. its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.,0
2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug 3 is a wakeup call to today's gamers mollycoddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. with its handanimated sprites and 2d sidescrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes that includes halo 2. simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d sidescrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on. players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screenfilling bosses that guard each of the five levels. the shootanythingthatmoves gameplay is peppered with moments of oldschool genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannontoting camels elephants and ostriches  more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere 20 metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says. of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates' eye.,2
call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet roguedialling scams according to premium phone line regulator icstis. it has received 45000 complaints in recent months about dialup internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis said. people who use dialup connections can be affected by the scams. without realising a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. icstis spokesman rob dwight said phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. if my bill goes over the usual 50 a month i want to know about it straight away  i don't want to be told when it's hit 750. phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificiallyinflated traffic he said. we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers he added. telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said certainly i would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if i do something out of the ordinary. so i would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach. the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made there's little that can be done. gavin patterson group managing director for bt consumer said we do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. we're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this. but as bt handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was quite a task in itself he added. the government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. at the moment it cannot demand payouts on the behalf of customer  it can only close illegal services down. i use free antivirus software avg and free firewall protection zonealarm. both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. how about isps informing all customers of such facilities the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues. ignorance is and always has been an expensive business. does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted  these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s porn and pirated software. if people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. whatever happened to personal responsibility it seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. a secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge. these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going why don't bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request to anyone who falls foul of this scam  refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you paying the bill. to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills. disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead  then you have nothing to worry about. or buy some decent firewall software and antivirus. you would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat  you would not drive your car without any insurance  so why not protect your pc stop blaming the phone companies  it's not their fault i was very impressed with our phone company recently. i had kept ringing a hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if i was aware there were 40odd calls to the same number. great service. and i got the tickets as well i have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. he informed the phone company about it they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. three months later another huge bill of over 1000 came in  the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it even though a block was in place. phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem. i have been scammed of 139. the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury i was charged vat by the government. premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly. i know people who have run up large bills despite being itliterate. from talking to bt in belfast i believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. it's not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it. it's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dialup altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dialup not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly. i haven't fallen victim to a roguedialling scam but i think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. in most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them. my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal 3 to 5 to 320. this was because of the scam. they simply billed me. what particularly galls me over and above having over 300 stolen is that the supplier and the government through vat are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses. how about an automatic monthly cap of say 20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. at least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for a telecoms operator to write off 20 than it is 750. a few years back i was also the target of such scams but thank god i have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all i heard was the sound of an attempted connection. how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their antivirus and firewall software is up to date that should prevent the vast majority of these scams.,2
keegan hails comeback king fowler manchester city boss kevin keegan has praised striker robbie fowler for his landmark return to form. the 29yearold out of favour at city earlier this season took his premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in monday's 32 win at norwich. he is still a quality player and knows where the net is  we have just got to supply him with ammunition and in the end we did keegan said. he has worked hard to get back to where he is now. the former liverpool striker who moved to city in 2003 after a poor stint at leeds has battled back into firstteam contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season. fowler overtook les ferdinand on tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the premiership with 151 goals and he only trails alan shearer 250 and andy cole 173. and keegan believes there is still more to come from the former england forward. he can get better if we can supply him better added keegan. people want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face. fowler's double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards. i feel a bit for nigel worthington he said. his team have got great character they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. i know it is a killer blow for norwich but i really think they have brought something to the premiership. the stadium and the atmosphere is great it is just a tough league to stay in  as they are finding out and as we know.,1
movie body hits peertopeer nets the movie industry has struck out at filesharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the us. the motion picture association of america mpaa also said it had succeeded in getting a network called lokitorrent closed down. it is the latest network which uses the peertopeer system called bittorrent to be hit by the mpaa. the mpaa began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in december. a dallas court agreed that hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to lokitorrent's server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. in october 2004 the site had provided links to more than 30000 files. the action came after the operators of lokitorrent agreed a settlement with the mpaa. a stark message has appeared on the site from the mpaa warning you can click but you can't hide. in bittorrent systems server sites do not host the files being shared. they host links called trackers that direct people to others that have it instead. as well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the us the mpaa said it had given operators that host edonkey servers take down notices. hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on filesharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and tv programmes then share the files online. but it is now targeting the operators of bittorrent networks themselves. it has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of bittorrent server sites since december. the strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt filesharers' ability to swap content using bittorrent systems. the film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and dvds already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal filesharing is adding to their losses. in december the legal action claimed its most highprofile victim. the popular suprnova.org website was forced to close and others like phoenix torrent followed soon after.,2
smart search lets art fans browse if you don't know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. artgarden developed by bt's research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures. clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works. the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. it 'chooses' a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement 19th century and water. a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tate's digital programme. for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn't have a clue what i wanted he said. the textbased search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful. he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead. he thinks the dominance of textbased searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. you don't arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see. one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn't have asked for he said. the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie. she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films.,2
prutton poised for lengthy fa ban southampton's david prutton faces a possible sevenmatch ban when he goes before the football association. the 23yearold has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal. the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman. and the second charge is for using threatening words andor behaviour to a match official during the 11 draw. paolo di canio was given a sevenmatch suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in a premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in 1998. prutton will be joined at wednesday's hearing by saints boss harry redknapp who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player. redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referee's assistant norman. david has made a big mistake and he knows it. i can't condone what he's done. he was out of order but he knows that said redknapp. he's a decent lad. he overreacted badly for some reason  he had a rush of blood from somewhere. off the pitch you couldn't meet a nicer lad. prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to arsenal's robert pires who was injured in a wild tackle by the saints' midfield man. he said it's an horrendous situation. i apologise to the ref and linesman who were only doing their job. i've also seen what happened to pires' leg and i'm sorry for that as well. i apologise for the people who saw it. i know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don't pay money to see that sort of thing. it's not a copout but it was all a bit of a blur. sometimes you react and it's beyond your control  added prutton.,1
computer grid to help the world your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems. launched this week the world community grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. the donated processor cycles will help the wcg create virtual supercomputers via the net. the idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop pcs. one of the most successful collaboration projects was setihome run by the search for extra terrestrial life project which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication. anyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the wgc website. once installed the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process and reports back after completing that task. the first wcg problem being tackled will be the human proteome folding project which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold. the subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences and technology. the body will evaluate proposals from leading research public and notforprofit organizations and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. organisations also represented on the board include the united nations development programme and the world health organisation. the world community grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues said elain gallin program director for medical research at the doris duke charitable foundation. it will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems she added. ibm has donated the hardware software technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid. the computer company working with united devices previously developed the smallpox research grid which linked together more than two million volunteers from 226 countries to speed the analysis of some 35 million drug molecules in the search for a treatment for smallpox.,2
nintendo ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of highprofile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mouldbreaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm's preeminence in an increasinglycompetitive mobile gaming market. nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while startup companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in midnovember priced 150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million preorders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters  a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine's wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a topdown map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful recreation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new minigames and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds's key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,2
who do you think you are the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompson. it is what happens when it arrives at the other end. the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data. the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society  our identities. armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name. and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish. but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a wellplaced insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. in fact i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. has anyone checked bob cratchit's family links to the criminal underworld i wonder and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. health authorities government agencies and of course the big ecommerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files. companies like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual's personal memory card. these solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with ecommerce and online trading  the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the 'back office'. it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked. in fact i do not know of a single case where an email containing payment details has led to card fraud. there are simply too many emails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. cd universe powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it. unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. this is not something we can just leave it to the market. the consequences of having one's identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly. after all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems. i doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so i know which i'd prefer. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,2
web logs aid disaster recovery some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern asia are on the internet  in the form of web logs or blogs. bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. indian writer rohit gupta edits a group blog called dogs without borders. when he created it the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between india and pakistan. but in the wake of sunday's tsunami mr gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears. they wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. one sri lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name morquendi. with internet service disrupted by the tsunami morquendi started sending sms text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of sri lanka. we started publishing these smses says mr gupta. morquendi was describing scenes like 1600 bodies washed up on a shore and people burying and burying and burying them. people digging holes with their hands. and this was coming through an sms message. we didn't have visual accounts on radio or on tv or in the print media. soon thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read morquendi's first hand accounts. in one message morquendi wrote about a sri lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. she was being swept away morquendi's message read. she grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. she says she watched the water pull her friend away. mr gupta says the power of morquendi's text message blogs was palpable. he was running around looking for friends burying bodies carrying bodies mr gupta says of morquendi. i can't even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports and doing the relief work at the same time. he was caught between being a journalist and being a human being. others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. dina mehta is an indian blogger who's helping with the newly created south east asia earthquake and tsunami blog. she says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts. what we're doing is we're building a resource she says. anyone who says ok i want to come and do some work in india volunteer in india or in sri lanka or malaysia this is the sort of onestopshop that they can come to for all sorts of resources  emergency help lines relief agencies aid agencies contacts for them etc. ms mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. imagine if they had this resource available to them if there was a disaster how quickly you could funnel aid in and get people to help she says. bloggers in the united states are also getting involved. ramdhan yadav kotamaraja is originally from india but now lives in dallas. mr kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. so he set up an online payment system on his website. then says mr kotamaraja the blogging world found out. all my blogger friends started linking up my site and i saw a lot of people other than my friends. i'd say 70 of the donations came from people i don't know. it's simply unbelievable to me that people that i don't know will come and start donating. news spreads quickly on weblogs a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. in sri lanka blogger morquendi is recruiting others to help. one recruit calls himself heretic. in one of his latest posts heretic asks have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road ever seen a bus inside a house well heretic writes that was just the least affected areas  so you can just imagine  or can you he concludes keep it blogged. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction.,2
games maker fights for survival one of britain's largest independent game makers argonaut games has been put up for sale. the londonbased company behind the harry potter games has sacked about 100 employees due to a severe cash crisis. the administrators told bbc news online that selling argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash. argonaut warned that it was low on cash 10 days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the london stock exchange. argonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the uk. along with its headquarters in north london it operates studios in cambridge and sheffield. argonaut was behind the harry potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company. but like all software developers argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. signs that it was in trouble emerged in august when it warned it was heading for losses of 6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games. those new deals were further delayed leading argonaut to warn in midoctober that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the london stock exchange. as part of costcutting measures some 100 employees were fired. when the news about the 6m loss came out we knew there were going to be redundancies said jason parkinson one of the game developers sacked by argonaut. a lot of people suspected that argonaut had been in trouble for some time he told bbc news online. mr parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save argonaut from going under. at the start of the year the company employed 268 people. after the latest round of cuts there are 80 staff at argonaut headquarters in edgware in north london with 17 at its morpheme offices in kentish town london and 22 at the just add monsters base in cambridge. argonaut called in administrators david rubin  partners on friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse. it spent the weekend going over the company's finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale. the administrator told bbc news online that the costs of restructuing would be too high partly because of the overheads from the company's four premises across the uk. it said it was hopeful that it could save some 110 jobs by selling the business saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale. the administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages redundancy or holiday pay due to them hopefully by christmas.,2
kenya lift chepkemei's suspension kenya's athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner susan chepkemei after she made an official apology. athletics kenya ak had suspended the twotime london marathon runnerup for failing to turn up to a crosscountry team training camp in embu. we have withdrawn the ban. chepkemei has given a reason for her absence said ak chief isaiah kiplagat. she explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in puerto rice and we have accepted her apology. the kenyan coaching team will now decide whether chepkemei can be included in the team for this month's world cross country championships. the 29yearold would be a strong contender at the event in france and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the 32strong squad. i am satisfied that the whole saga has been brought to an end chepkemei said. i am ready and prepared to represent my country. i will be disappointed if i am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships. ak had insisted it was making an example of chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005. but the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision. the 29yearold took part in the 2002 and 2003 london marathons and was edged out by radcliffe in an epic new york marathon contest last year. the twotime world halfmarathon silver medallist will be back to challenge radcliffe at this year's london event in april. ak also dropped its harsh stance on threetime world cross country 4km champion edith masai. masai missed kenya's world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but ak insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured. subject to our doctor's confirmation we have decided to clear masai added kiplagat.,1
us duo in first spam conviction a brother and sister in the us have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited email messages to aol subscribers. it is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors. jurors in virginia recommended that the man jeremy jaynes serve nine years in prison and that his sister jessica degroot be fined 7500. they were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk emails using fake addresses. they will be formally sentenced next year. a third defendant richard rutkowski was acquitted. prosecutors said jaynes was a snake oil salesman in a new format using the internet to peddle useless wares news agency associated press reported. a fedex refund processor was supposed to allow people to earn 75 an hour working from home. another item on sale was an internet history eraser. his sister helped him process credit card payments. jaynes amassed a fortune of 24m from his sales prosecutors said. he's been successful ripping people off all these years ap quoted prosecutor russell mcguire as saying. jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100000 emails in 30 days virginia state attorney general jerry kilgore reportedly said. prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for jaynes and a jail term for his sister. but jaynes' lawyer david oblon called the nineyear recommended term outrageous and said his client believed he was innocent. he pointed out that all three of the accused lived in north carolina and were unaware of the virginia state law. spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60 of all emails sent.,2
parry puts gerrard 'above money' listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt. but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future. he told bbc five live steven is above money. he is the future of liverpool. it doesn't matter if it's 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will. on the subject of liverpool's finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield  and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard. on the subject of liverpool's captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same  steven is not for sale. but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa's views. we have reaffirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. we all want to see progress by next season. he's not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim. it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30mplus bid in the summer  but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn't had an offer last summer parry explained. we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. in reality it didn't go beyond that. maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won't. our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven  and he has enough respect for us  to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn't work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. you can forget that. parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool's new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenal's 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground  complete with naming rights  has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eyeopener. i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow  that's interesting.' my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium. some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell. i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to. that's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore. on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there's no need and that is not the way we do business. we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it. steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn't closed on anything. we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year. we have a common interest in making liverpool successful. that's a dream we all share so as far as i'm concerned the door is not closed. i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him. as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don't care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard's quality. through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard's transfer for any fee over 35m. parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly if he isn't then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you

slim playstation triples sales sony playstation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers with 50000 sold in its first week on sale. sales have tripled since launch outstripping microsoft's xbox said market analysts charttrack. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2only game grand theft auto san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677000 copies. it is obviously very very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week john houlihan editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news. and with halo 2 for xbox out next week it really is a headtohead contest between them and xbox. although xbox sales over the last week also climbed ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburghbased developer rockstar which is behind the gta titles has seen san andreas pull in an estimated 24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took 11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings the return of the king took nearly 10m over its opening weekend although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. gangsterthemed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastestselling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2 released on 11 november in the uk is also widely tipped to be one of the bestselling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001 and sold more than four million copies. mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2 but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the runup to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft's xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. both have hit crucial price points at around 100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales said mr houlihan.,2
sony psp console hits us in march us gamers will be able to buy sony's playstation portable from 24 march but there is no news of a europe debut. the handheld console will go on sale for 250 132 and the first million sold will come with spiderman 2 on umd the disc format for the machine. sony has billed the machine as the walkman of the 21st century and has sold more than 800000 units in japan. the console 12cm by 7.4cm will play games movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming. sony is entering a market which has been dominated by nintendo for many years. it launched its ds handheld in japan and the us last year and has sold 2.8 million units. sony has said it wanted to launch the psp in europe at roughly the same time as the us but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back. nintendo has said it will release the ds in europe from 11 march. it has gaming at its core but it's not a gaming device. it's an entertainment device said kaz hirai president of sony computer entertainment america.,2
looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner. more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slowdown in replacement sales. all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years' time. they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones. but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner. third generation mobiles 3g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical. nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added. this was not a women's thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of selfexpression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner. western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi. people are after something that is nicelooking and together with that there is the entertainment side. this year music will have a part to play in this. the market for fulltrack music downloads was worth just 20 million 10.5 million in 2004 but is set to be worth 1.8 billion 9.4 million by 2009 according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w800 which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life and a two megapixel camera. in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola's standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life.,2
nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world's nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors. a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency iaea said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old. such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software. a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information said project manager livio costantini. iaea inspectors make around 3000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility. the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant. where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman. computer specialist at the iaea peter smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspector's toolkit. the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world he said. if we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look. and if there's a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem. the iaea estimates the total cost of the fouryear project to upgrade its technology will be 40m. so far it has only received 11m from the us and the uk. failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks said an agency statement.,2
lawyer attacks antiterror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's antiterror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name. ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. he was part of a 19strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign. mr macdonald told bbc news the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community. i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally. under the antiterrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. as far as i'm concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this. he added. the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday. according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers  nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare. they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac  a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects. mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow. but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio 4's today programme that more lawyers may go. i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said. they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights. helena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said. without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.,0

profile david blunkett before he resigned the position of home secretary on wednesday david blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race policing and immigration. his responsibilities in running the home office included civil emergencies security terrorism and expenditure. named home secretary after the 2001 general election mr blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. the attacks on the world trade center on 11 september 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. a labour loyalist from a working class background mr blunkett 57 had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to labour policy. recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. mr blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister beverly hughes. having received his full backing ms hughes was forced to resign in april over abuses in the visa processing system which she claimed to be unaware of. mr blunkett's own comments on immigration had prompted censure  he told refugees from afghanistan and kosovo to get back home to start rebuilding their countries. and he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a sense of belonging in britain telling them to speak english at home. avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary who spurns a metropolitan elite and airy fairy libertarians and earlier in the year coined the phrase liberati as an amalgam of glitterati and liberal. yet in january of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis from a grade b to grade c status drug . before the recent furore mr blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. mr blunkett told the daily telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring in spite of being a divorcee as a useful way of ensuring that people don't casually think i am available. he added i am not available because i am just getting on with the job. mr blunkett entered parliament for sheffield brightside in 1987 after first contesting the sheffield hallam seat in 1974. he is one of very few blind mps and was the first to reach the front bench and the cabinet. his relaxed performances  with his guide dog by his side  at the despatch box in the labour party's national executive and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. mr blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply an inconvenience. using braille for speeches and briefed by his officials on tape he also has a sharp tongue at times and a pragmatic approach to politics. mr blunkett was schooled in sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the commons. he chaired the labour party nationally and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s shadowing health and education. in tony blair's first government mr blunkett was put in charge of education and employment where he won big increases in funds for schools while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. he was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions  which sometimes heckled his speeches  and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. in the labour party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague a conciliator who avoids factions and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. there have been wry smiles as well. in 1999 his then guide dog lucy threw up in the chamber during the speech of his tory opponent. lucy was replaced by her halfsister sadie a black labradorcurlycoated retriever cross in 2003 after nearly a decade by mr blunkett's side.,0
tory leader quits legal position david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role. the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports. but on friday he said i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect. mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. labour said he had cleverly not asked about paid advocacy. a tory spokesman totally refuted any wrongdoing. mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport. the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development. mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. explaining his reason for quitting the post mr mcletchie said i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray. however i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future. labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was very clever to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6 the section on paid advocacy she said. section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner. however msps' code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings including a nonstatutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions. but a letter from holyrood's chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. commenting on mr mcletchie's decision to stand down a scottish labour party spokesman said this should mean mr mcletchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. however it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past. scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. ms sturgeon said i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and i'm sure he will be reflecting on it. she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not lose any sleep over it. peter misselbrook executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year. he added david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.,0
council tax rise 'reasonable' welsh councils should set their taxes at reasonable levels after being given an average funding increase of 6 says the assembly government. finance minister sue essex said it was a good deal for local government. the 3.2bn settlement includes the full 7.4m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown. but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. in addition 13.4m will come from the business support grant  a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. she said where spending rises were kept to around 5 she was confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels. the welsh local government association wlga had said on the eve of the announcement said that significant cuts to services may still be unavoidable. after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington of torfaen said it was vital that rises were minimsed. a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems said mr wellington. it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase. on monday a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds. ms essex said i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties. she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels even for those people who have moved up a band. the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4 rise in capital expenditure support. ms essex said this is a good deal for local government which will allow the wellmanaged councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level. plaid cymru's local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement hugely disappointing. he said wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims  it is anger. this will mean either a massive hike in council tax massive cuts in services provided by councils or both. mike german leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. mr german said i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. but the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty. conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change is taking spin to the very verge of deception. he added around a third of welsh households have been revalued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.,0
movie body targets children's pcs the body that represents the us movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie filesharing aimed at parents. the movie association for america's mpaa free parent file scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peertopeer programs. it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it. our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files said dan glickman mpaa chief. many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they've downloaded it from. but some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. movie piracy cost the industry 3.7bn 7bn in 2003 according to analysts. the mpaa said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat the deleterious effects of peertopeer software including such common problems as viruses trojan horses and identity theft. mr glickman said that the film industry was embracing digital age technologies like movielink and cinemanow which are legal movie sites. but legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive he added. the industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movieswappers across the us but did not say how many were being sued. its first set of lawsuits were filed in november 2004. it also started a campaign against operators of bittorrent edonkey and directconnect peertopeer networks. the first convictions for peertopeer piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software.,2
mps issued with blackberry threat mps will be thrown out of the commons if they use blackberries in the chamber speaker michael martin has ruled. the 200 handheld computers can be used as a phone pager or to send emails. the devices gained new prominence this week after alastair campbell used his to accidentally send an expletiveladen message to a newsnight journalist. mr martin revealed some mps had been using their blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces. the use of electronic devices in the commons chamber has long been frowned on. the sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the speaker or his deputies. the speaker chairs debates in the commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the house. he or she is always an mp chosen by colleagues who once nominated gives up all party political allegiances.,0

mrs howard gets key election role michael howard's exmodel wife sandra is to play a leading role in the conservative election campaign. mrs howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail crisscrossing the country. mr howard will host a news conference at the party's london hq every morning tory cochairman liam fox said. we want michael to be as accessible as possible mr fox said adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny. the tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public mr fox said. tony blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign. but labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for mr blair to hold a daily news conference. mr fox responded by accusing the prime minister of hiding away from the scrutiny of london's media. the liberal democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with charles kennedy. on mrs howard's role mr fox said sandra has already been campaigning with michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. that pattern will continue. it's worked very well up until now. mrs howard made her debut speech at the conservative party conference in bournemouth last october. she used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity addaction which she supports. mrs howard has also appeared along side her husband on tv chat shows. during an interview on itv1's this morning she said she often criticised her husband for not showing the side of him that she knows.,0
labour's 'eu propaganda' a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security say the tories. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw who accused the tories of running scared of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls he argued. mr straw used thursday's commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1 of europe's economic output and were spent where it adds most value. mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk's budget rebate secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher was fully justified. we like all other countries have a veto on any changes proposed in this area he said. mr ancram condemned the document which the foreign office says has cost about 2500 to design print and deliver. isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand. the government last week had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the british people he said. who are they trying to kid the proposed question for the constitution referendum is should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006 with the tories set to campaign for a no vote. mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a level playing field on immigration and asylum controls. you are setting your face against all of these things he added. for the liberal democrats sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans backed by the uk to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken  chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.,0
uk heading wrong way  howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said. britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair's government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added. but labour's campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded britain is working don't let the tories wreck it again. mr howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said. we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp. yet britain's response has shone a light on our nation's character. the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever. he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear. looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain. how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them. the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice. worst of all it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today. the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. we can have progress without losing what makes britain great  its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change. this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account. but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april not 1 january. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15 interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax. with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country.,0
rich pickings for hitech thieves viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change. the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code. the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package. you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in email message attachments. it's about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cashrich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the 29a virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common. in many ways the least likely way to do it is email because most of us have got antivirus and firewalls now he said. few of the malicious programs written by hitech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works. as the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network. many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. socalled spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.,2
brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour's next general election bid. he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs's creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party's election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn  a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour's campaign and praised his handling of the economy. writing in the guardian newspaper mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking. as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment not just attacking ignorance disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education good health and sustainable communities. bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown's article was a warning shot to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. it was as always coded and careful... but entirely deliberate was mr marr's assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4's today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be central. mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr brown's management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of labour's manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a tough tough fight for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote  warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.,0
fa probes crowd trouble the fa is to take action after trouble marred wednesday's carling cup tie between chelsea and west ham. police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the west ham support after the match which the blues won 10. mateja kezman the scorer of chelsea's goal needed treatment on a head injury during the match after being hit by a missile believed to be a coin. a spokeswoman for chelsea said the club would await the referee's report before deciding on its course of action. kezman was forced off the field to receive treatment on a cut above his eye but was able to continue. chelsea assistant boss steve clarke said i would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd. he did not require stitches. west ham boss alan pardew said it's a shame because i thought there was good english banter in the crowd. there's big rivalry between the two clubs and it is a shame if that's happened. from where i was standing i didn't see any trouble. former hammers star joe cole also had a plastic bottle thrown at him while frank lampard was pelted with coins as he was preparing to take a penalty. lampard's spotkick was saved to the delight of the hammers' fans who have still not forgiven him for leaving upton park. the fa will seek reports from the clubs and the police and will review video evidence and the referee's report. police in riot gear battled with west ham fans in the matthew harding stand and at least one supporter required treatment. fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game. scotland yard said there had been 11 arrests for alleged public order drugs and offensive weapon offences. the fa is already looking into the trouble at tuesday's heated carling cup tie between millwall and liverpool.,1
digital guru floats sub100 pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit's media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than 100 53. he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be  very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood. he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. the second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. we put in 25 laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it's also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook. mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years we're talking about months. he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. in china they spend 17 per child per year on textbooks. that's for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.,2
bbc leads interactive bafta wins the bbc and the national theatre have led the field at this year's interactive bafta awards. the national theatre's stagework website picked up the prize for best learning as well as top factual site. the bbc collected three awards including best online entertainment for the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy adventure game. spooks interactive took the best interactive tv prize. the annual awards recognise the best in digital media. bbc sport interactive fought off competition from cbbc newsround and the guardian to take home the best news and sport trophy for its coverage of england's exit from euro 2004. it was recognised for its groundbreaking use of animation. bafta's grant dean chair of bafta's interactive entertainment committee said all the entrants had been of outstanding quality and that judging had been enormously difficult. without a doubt 2005 has been a landmark year for the bafta interactive awards he added. many of the top awards this year have gone to the companies we most commonly associate with traditional entertainment showing how the gap between new media film and television is closing. awards were given out in 12 different categories including interactive tv film music design as well as technical and social innovation at a london ceremony. the top music award was given to sseyo minimixa a mobile music sequencer designed to let people write edit and share compositions. warner bros was given two prizes for its inspiring efforts in film and dvd interactivity. the chaplin collection beat oasis really bend it like beckham shaun of the dead and the day today in the dvd category and trauma won best film. elsewhere fashionista and clothes designer alexander mcqueen took the accolade for the bestdesigned website. the awards have been running since 1997 but in 2002 the british academy of film and television decided to split them into separate games and interactive ceremonies. on tuesday halflife 2 dominated the games prizes. it collected six baftas including best game and best online game.,2
legendary dutch boss michels dies legendary dutch coach rinus michels the man credited with developing total football has died aged 77. referred to in the netherlands as the general michels led the dutch at the 1974 world cup  when they reached the final only to lose 21 to germany. however he guided his side to the 1988 european championship title with a 20 win over the soviet union in the final. michels played for ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 196571 and a european cup in 1971. his 1970s dutch team was built around johan cruyff and johan neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. the strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination  with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. cruyff was the onfield organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. michels had recently undergone heart surgery and dutch football federation knvb spokesman frank huizinga said he was one of the best coaches we had in history. the nononsense coach also enjoyed spells at barcelona who he took to a spanish title in 1974 fc cologne and bayer leverkusen. michels named coach of the century by world football's governing body fifa in 1999 also won five caps for the netherlands as a bruising centre forward. dutch sports minister clemence rossvan dorp said he was the man who together with cruyff made dutch football big.,1

robben sidelined with broken foot chelsea winger arjen robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks. robben had an mri scan on the injury sustained during the premiership win at blackburn on monday. six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then i need a few more weeks to be completely fit again he told dutch newspaper algemeen dagblad. i had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis. the 21yearold missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with roma's olivier dacourt. and he added it felt different then last summer when i had the same injury on my other foot. then i could walk already after three days but i stayed sidelined for a long period. i hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks. chelsea physio mike banks was hopeful that robben could return at some point in march. the fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month banks told the club's website. one is a chip on the side of his foot the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months. david beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 world cup in korea and japan. robben who has been a key part of the blues' push for four trophies claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by blackburn midfielder aaron mokoena. i felt my leg go he said. i felt it straight away after mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.,1

uk net users leading tv downloads british tv viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading us shows from the net according to research. new episodes of 24 desperate housewives and six feet under appear on the web hours after they are shown in the us said a report. web tracking company envisional said 18 of downloaders were from within the uk and that downloads of tv programmes had increased by 150 in the last year. about 70 were using filesharing program bittorrent the firm said. it's now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr said ben coppin from envisional. a typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100000 people globally said the report and an estimated 20000 of those were from within the uk. fans of many popular us tv programmes like 24 usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk. but in some cases said the report people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country. missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet explained mr coppin. two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. in effect the internet is now a global video recorder. exact figures are difficult to pin down but it is thought that about 80000 to 100000 people in the uk download tv programmes. some may just want the odd episode others are downloading regularly. many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content like tv programmes. this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. the industry has coined the term timeshifting to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want when you want. the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders tivotype boxes which automatically record programmes like sky have also contributed to the trend. there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer. within half an hour recorded episodes can be uploaded  or posted  onto filesharing networks or other download sites. because they tend to be shorter then fulllength films they can be processed  digitised  quickly. more people with highspeed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly. according to jupiter research 40 of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. the bbc ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player imp last year which was based on a peertopeer distribution model. it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. the bbc already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. about six million people in the uk now have a fast alwayson net connection via cable or phone lines.,2
school sport 'is back' says pm tony blair has promised that sport is back as a priority for schools. the prime minister launched a 500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. it's an important part of education and it's an important part of health mr blair said. but the conservatives say government proposals  which include two hours' pe within school for 75 of pupils by 2006  are unrealistic. the latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport with activities such as yoga and tai chi being options. launching the initiative mr blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the allgirl waverley sports college in southwark south london. he said you've got to bring back school sport. it's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. it's still very very important. earlier education secretary charles clarke told bbc news there were at least three areas which needed a coherent framework and dedicated funding. these were training for pe teachers establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as interschool competitions. he added the government had originally pledged for every pupil to get at least two hours of highquality physical education a week. the proportion was currently at 62 and the government was hoping this would rise to 85 by 2008 and 100 by 2010. the money for the initiative will come from a new 500m fund. the 500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs  which is where the real passion for sport exists  to deliver the school sport offer. he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports saying that an anticompetitive sport agenda had been pursued in recent years. martin ward of the secondary heads association said members did not like ringfenced funds and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.,0
britons fed up with net service a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service. they are fed up with slow speeds high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17 of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16 are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt the uk's biggest internet supplier with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining. a third of the 2000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton editor of pc pro magazine. we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping. other found themselves tied into 12month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12 of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. we discovered a huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier said tim danton editor of pc pro. this breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or ofcom can do to help he said. there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. if you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off he warned.,2
us blogger fired by her airline a us airline attendant suspended over inappropriate images on her blog  web diary  says she has been fired. ellen simonetti known as queen of the sky wrote an anonymous semifictional account of her life in the sky. she was suspended by delta in september. in a statement she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for wrongful termination. a delta spokesperson confirmed on wednesday that ms simonetti was no longer an employee. delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls internal employee matters. a spokesperson reiterated this position on wednesday confirming only that ms simonetti was no longer with the company. the spokesperson also confirmed that there were very clear rules attached to the unauthorised use of delta branding including uniforms. ms simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 november. she said in an official statement as a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by delta airlines i am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the federal government eeoc us equal employment opportunity commission. she added she had also hired a texasbased law firm to initiate legal action for wrongful termination defamation of character and lost future wages. ms simonetti told the bbc news website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 september. queen of the sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the bbc news website and others. her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites. the blog which she started in january as a way of getting over her mother's death contains a mix of fictional and nonfictional accounts. queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti. in the postings she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity. but some postings contained images of herself in uniform. of the 10 or so images only one showed ms simonetti's flight wings. she removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. i never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said. a legal expert in the us speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted. delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition. it has said it needs to cut between 6000 and 7000 jobs and reduce costs by 5bn 2.7bn a year. analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention. last week it struck a 1bn costcutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy. the deal would see pilots accept a 32 pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million delta shares unions said. and on monday it negotiated a deal to defer about 135m in debt which was due next year until 2007. the airline also said it had agreed the terms of a 600m loan from american express.,2
bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor. lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90 of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a fiveyear plan to help build confidence in the justice system. ministers say the strategy is aimed at rebalancing the court system towards victims and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs' plan lord falconer said one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed. courts judges magistrates prosecutors police and victim support  all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first without compromising the rights of the defendant. he went on giving evidence is a nervewracking experience especially when you're a victim. yet with a will and with support it can be done. lord falconer told bbc radio 4's today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence he said. but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem it's not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them. the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925 as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday. ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor but the lords have overruled this. lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords he said and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. what they did not what they were called was the critical issue he added.,0
telewest to challenge sky plus cable firm telewest is to offer a personal video recorder pvr in a set top box to challenge sky plus. sky plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the uk with 474000 subscribers. pvrs record tv programmes to a hard drive letting viewers pause and rewind live television and effectively time shift the viewing experience. a number of pvrs incorporating freeview digital terrestrial tv are also on the market but their success is limited. telewest's pvr will offer a 160gb hard drive which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes. the box has three tuners which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel. sky plus boxes come in two versions  a 20gb version for 99 and a 160gb version for 399. sky also charges a 10 subscription fee to the service unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages. telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service. eric tveter president and chief operating officer at telewest broadband said we will make our pvr settop box available later this year putting a stop to missed soaps interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record. pvrs and recordable dvd players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite tv programmes. last year high street retailer dixons said it was going to stop selling vhs machines in favour of pvrs and recordable dvd machines. sky has said it aims to have 25 of its subscribers using sky plus by 2010  it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date. it currently has 7.4 million subscribers while telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers.,2
supercomputer breaks speed record the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm's prototype blue genel machine. it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory a us department of energy doe lab. doe test results show that blue genel has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. the current top machine japan's nec earth simulator clocks up 35.86. due next week the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second. the speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles. the us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed according to the linpack benchmark. until the official list is published however blue genel's position will not be confirmed and there are expected to be some other new entries. but the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second teraflop mark has been considered a landmark for some time. the ibm blue genel is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005. its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops and will fit into 64 full racks. it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers. the final machine will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the us's nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing. the earth simulator has held on to the top spot since june 2002. it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. but in september ibm said that another blue genel machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops marginally surpassing the earth simulator's performance. this was achieved during internal testing at ibm's production facility in rochester minnesota though so was not an official record. another giant to enter the fray is silicon graphics' columbia supercomputer based at nasa's ames research center in california. it would be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering. the linuxbased machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in october. supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts help design better cars and improve disease diagnosis. ibm's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing nick donofrio believes that by 2006 blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing. this means it would be capable of doing 1000 trillion operations a second. when you get a computer as large as a petaflop you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world mr donofrio recently told the bbc news website. you can start to be more proactive more interactive and more innovative. one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing  and blue gene machines in particular  as crucial is health. he believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century protein folding. health is one of the most important problems not just mapping the human genome but also protein structures. we are a great believer in simulation. it gives you another tool he said. once the structures of proteins are understood fully then drugs can be tailormade to fight diseases more effectively. compared with the current fastest supercomputers blue gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. since the first supercomputer the cray1 was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976 computational speed has leaped 500000 times. the cray1 was capable of 80 megaflops 80 million operations a second. the blue genel machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. started in 1993 the top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh.,2
blogger grounded by her airline a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary. queen of the sky otherwise known as ellen simonetti evolved into an anonymous semifictional account of life in the sky. but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images. delta airlines declined to comment. i was really shocked i had no warning ms simonetti told bbc news online. i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog. i thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action. the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites. ms simonetti was suspended on 25 september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc. a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media. she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past. ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother's death. she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies. the airline's name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville. a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti. the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother. we often take pictures on flight or on layovers. i just though why not include them on my blog for fun. i never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said. she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web. of the 10 or so images on the site only one showed ms simonetti's flight wings. they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with. i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said. the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. as far as ms simonetti knows there is no company antiblogging policy. there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear. jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees. there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said. it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy. you have to remember that as an employee you don't have total free speech anymore he said. mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog. one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line. he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted. whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said. ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs. one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken. if they had asked me just take down the blog i would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said. this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. if i had known it would cost me my job i would not have done that.,2
campbell to extend sprint career darren campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting. campbell who won olympic 4x100m relay gold had been unsure about his future. but he told five live's sportsweek i had to get back into training before i could decide because if i didn't have the same hunger i'd have to walk away. i've started back and i'm thoroughly enjoying it. i'm looking forward to it. i've got to run under 10 seconds for 100m and under 20 seconds for 200m. campbell was part of the british quartet who shocked the americans to win relay gold in athens in august. the newportbased athlete and teammates jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis were rewarded with mbes in the new year honours list. campbell's relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in athens when he failed to reach the finals. the 31yearold who won olympic 200m silver in sydney in 2000 said during the games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best. he was criticised at the time by former olympic champion michael johnson who cast doubt on campbell's injury claims. to go to athens and finally get the gold i've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief said campbell. it was a chance for me to prove that if i'd been fit i would have been challenging for the individual medals. every season i go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different it's just unfortunate that i picked up that injury just before the olympics. campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the european title in budapest in 1998. and he ran 20.13secs in the quarterfinals of the 200m in sydney on the way to olympic silver.,1
'evil twin' fear for wireless net people using wireless highspeed net wifi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points. the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts. once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted. wifi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. london leads the global wifi hotspots league with more than 1000. the number of hotspots is expected to reach 200000 by 2008 according to analysts. users need to be wary of using their wifi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university. users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wifi device has its security measures activated he added. bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wifi secure. naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bt's wireless broadband. but wifi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dialup. he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. this means that users' personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark. in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles. cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield. because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency. although wifi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use highspeed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is. some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. public wifi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. but many home and company wifi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hijacked by anyone with the correct equipment. bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark. we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted. dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museum's dana centre in london on thursday.,2
hunt demo at labour meeting prohunt supporters are set to protest at labour's spring conference. the countryside alliance says it expects up to 4000 supporters to demonstrate against the hunting ban. they have agreed to keep to a demonstration site on the other side of the river tyne from the conference venue in gateshead. a bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales has begun in the court of appeal. the ban comes into force on 18 february. the court of appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance's challenge has succeeded. richard dodd regional director of the countryside alliance said he expected between 2000 and 4000 supporters in tyneside to make their protest with hunt horns and placards. campaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol. mr dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the prohunt demonstration outside parliament in september. we are holding a static demonstration just to remind labour that we are not going away he said. northumbria police said the pedestrian millennium bridge by the demonstration site will be shut if necessary. but assistant chief constable david warcup has liaised with several protest groups and said all negotiations had gone well. fathers 4 justice pensioners' rights activists and stop the war campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the threeday conference which starts on friday. prohunt campaigners claims the 1949 parliament act  which extends the right of the house of commons to overrule the house of lords  was itself invalid because it was never passed by peers. the high court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful. prohunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in london's high court on thursday. the countryside alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds. animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary.,0
record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham. and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record. apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. mind you every time she breaks the record she gets 30000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for kelly holmes. she looked good and was very positive. agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly. my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in madrid. he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners. jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish. it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. my view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. having said that mark is looking in much better shape. but i haven't seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france's ronald pognon  who has run 6.45 seconds  will be under threat at the europeans. from a british point of view sarah claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet. something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships. scotland's lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal. from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3000m but i don't think the pacemaking was great. canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given defar a real run for her money. she had a go but just could not hang in there. we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men's 1500m. but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape. as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti. but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season. it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.,1
cheaper chip for mobiles a mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful. the speciallydesigned chip developed by texas instruments could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3d gaming and 30frameasecond video. currently rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. the technology omapvox is being tested by firms in europe and asia and could appear by the end of the year. texas which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. we're going to drive them down into meatandpotatoes phones that have the largest market share said doug rasor a marketing vice president at texas. the chip also uses much less power than conventional chips said texas which means less strain on mobile battery life. more than 50 million people own a mobile in the uk but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. texas is keen to cash in on the third generation 3g of mobile technology which offers highspeed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. but it faces stiff competition from the likes of intel which is also looking to provide better chips for highend mobiles. competition to get people using 3g mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the uk's operators have now launched third generation networks. a recent survey by sony ericsson predicted that the number of 3g handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10 of all phones sold. many consumers are still to be convinced though. a further recent survey said that only 4 of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3g phones. many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard. but there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. earlier in january ntt docomo and vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of highspeed networks known as super 3g intended to be 10 times faster than 3g services. the first stage of development is to be completed by 2007 but no date has been set for a commercial launch the newlydesigned omapvox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference 3gsm which takes place in cannes france this week.,2
lewisfrancis eyeing world gold mark lewisfrancis says his olympic success has made him determined to bag world championship 100m gold in 2005. the 22yearold pipped maurice greene on the last leg of the 4x100m relay in athens to take top honours for team gb. but individually the birchfield harrier has yet to build on his world junior championship win four years ago. the gold medal in athens has made me realise that i can get to the top level and i want to get there again. it can happen i don't see why not he said. lewisfrancis has still to decided what events will feature in his buildup to the worlds  with one exception. he has confirmed his participation in the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on 18 february where he will take on another member of britain's victorious men's relay team  jason gardener  over 60m. he added it's a bit too early to make any predictions for helsinki but i have my eyes open and i know i can be the best in the world.,1
profile david miliband david miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to cabinet office minister. elected in a safe labour seat in 2001 his previous job was school standards minister  a role he won in may 2002. prior to the last election he was a key figure in new labour as the head of the downing street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing team. seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government he was also working for tony blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition. a brief glance at mr miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father ralph who died in 1994. he was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. and while david miliband is seen as a key blair lieutenant his brother ed is a special advisor to chancellor gordon brown. prior to working for mr blair david miliband spent time at the leftleaning institute for public policy research. he then became secretary of the commission on social justice. the 39yearold was educated at haverstock comprehensive before going on to oxford to study politics philosophy and economics. he also took an msc in political science from the massachusetts institute of technology.,0
escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded. michael ferguson 36 escaped after being allowed out of the highsecurity carstairs unit. the snp's nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave. the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval. an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister. ms brankin said the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this. ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out. she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety. police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday. the scottish national party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers. she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs. however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient  and any restricted patient  leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers. she added i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact. i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on. this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases. police said ferguson posed a danger to the public. bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation. he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs. the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it. but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised. scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen. the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers. she said ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off. they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision. ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors' surgery in coatbridge in 1994 had been out to see his fianc233e annabella holmes 47 whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire. he is described as being 5ft 9ins tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion. ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen. he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye. ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday. strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on .,0
balco case trial date pushed back the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative balco steroid distribution case has been postponed. us judge susan illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing  which was due to take place on wednesday  until 6 june. no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september. balco founder victor conte along with james valente coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes. anderson's clients include barry bonds and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pretrial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. the hearing in june will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on balco's offices and anderson's home. conte and anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. balco has been accused by the united states antidoping agency usada of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil. former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain's former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a twoyear ban after testing positive for thg in an outofcompetition test in 2003. and american sprinter marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against conte following his allegations that he gave her performanceenhancing drugs.,1
faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons  or social cohesion and democracy will suffer says the education watchdog. independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief david bell for not doing enough to promote the wider tenets of british society. mr bell said muslim jewish and evangelical christian schools must be intolerant of intolerance. diversity certainly must not mean segregated or separate he said. mr bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship  with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more. badlytaught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell and in a speech to the hansard society he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools  which he said included about 100 muslim 100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools. mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a common heritage and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. i worry that many young people are being educated in faithbased schools with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools. many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony. mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were tricky issues. but he argued that we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation. i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens equal under the law should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community be they women or people living in nontraditional relationships said mr bell.,0
fast moving phone bugs appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use shortrange radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects highend handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system. despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir. the original cabir worm came to light in midjune 2004 when it was sent to antivirus firms as a proofofconcept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm fsecure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. antivirus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian's series 60 software is licenced by nokia lg electronics lenovo panasonic samsung sendo and siemens.,2
newcastle 21 bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton's 10game unbeaten run. lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a wellstruck volley. but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the firsthalf  keeping out shearer's low shot and dyer's closerange header  but that was the only goalmouth action of note. and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. bowyer found space with a neat turn on the halfway line and striding forward picked out carr to his right. he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr's cross with a downward header into the far corner. bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well. they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos. jayjay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a firsttime strike. the magpies were opened up again before halftime as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post. but the home side survived and they should have retaken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through. but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant freekick laurent robert curled the ball just wide. bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies. their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute. alan shearer's snapshot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards.  bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the secondhalf performance. in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality. i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half. we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked.  newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win. we had a really good second half. bolton are a difficult side to play. you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football. we had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that. the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals. newcastle given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert jenas 77 ameobi shearer. subs not used butt harper milner hughes. goals bowyer 35 dyer 69. bolton jaaskelainen hunt fadiga 14 n'gotty ben haim candela giannakopoulos okocha vaz te 77 hierro campo 64 speed gardner davies. subs not used jaidi poole. booked ben haim hierro. goals giannakopoulos 41. att 50430 ref s dunn gloucestershire.,1
'fido' to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote the uk elections watchdog has said. those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on 5 may as expected. but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election. the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote  such as their own voting number date of birth and signature. the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process  which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system. there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the mps heard. and some people have registered all their family regardless of their age  birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. nonbritish citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases. mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at hard to reach voters for example. some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. mr younger said using the royal mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50000 voters. he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. he said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. currently british voters have to reregister to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. mr younger suggested the reregistration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were uptodate.,0
brown visits slum on africa trip chancellor gordon brown has visited kenya's biggest shantytown as he opened a weeklong visit to africa. mr brown's trip is designed to highlight how the uk wants to make africa's problems a priority of its chairmanship of the g8 this year. he will see an hivaids orphanage in tanzania and a women's credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town. at slums in narobi on wednesday he said education needs had to be tackled. speaking outside the olympic primary school mr brown said it is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education. he pointed to international plans to invest 10bn for education in africa over the next decade. the school is on the edge of kibera where 800000 live often in huts made of mud scrap metal and cardboard. mr brown's aides say he wants to find out more about the kenyan government's education policies which included introducing free primary education in early 2003. the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two. the trip follows claims of infighting between mr brown and tony blair detailed in a new book. conservative leader michael howard is expected to seize on those reports at prime minister's questions at 1200 gmt on wednesday.,0
mobile gaming takes off in india gaming on the move is one of the fastestgrowing activities among the techsavvy in india says a report. the indian mobile gaming market is expected to generate about 26m 13.8m by the end of 2004 according to market analysts instatmdr. in october mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million overtaking the number of landlines said the telecom regulatory authority of india. analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. india has a large population of under25s and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as musthave gadgets. india's mobile gaming market will bring in about 336m 178m by 2009 according to the report. mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009 generating billions for mobile companies. services other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in india have as a result of the huge rise in subscribers grown significantly and rapidly. the growth of this market sector has attracted publishers developers animators musicians and content providers and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models said clint wheelock director of instatmdr's wireless research group. mobile gaming is not just about fun it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players. currently india has six big games developers and four mobile operators that offer games to their subscribers said the report. according to instatmdr it is tipped to make up one of the most important markets in the next wave of mobile multimedia growth. in january 2003 there were only 10 million mobile subscribers in india. many choose mobiles in rural areas in order to bypass poorer telecoms infrastructure. despite this the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries. less than 20 of india's total population own a mobile in india compared to well over 50 in most european countries. the trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive staterun fixedline operators.,2
uk pioneers digital film network the world's first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next 18 months. the uk film council has awarded a contract worth 11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema aadc who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment. high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films. most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. the new network will double the world's total of digital screens. cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server. each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabytesize file. fiona deans associate director of aadc said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur. the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made  there is no degradation in quality over time. the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films documentaries and foreign language films. access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk said pete buckingham head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council. although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas the choice for many outside these areas remains limited and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print  giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films said ms deans. it can cost up to 1500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer. the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors  which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048  1080 pixels. a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may. the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum  they don't need to be shown twice a day explained ms deans. a cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks  even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. with digital prints every cinema will have its own copy.,2
tories attack eu asylum moves david blunkett has been accused of using the politics of confusion to disguise new eu immigration measures. tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain. the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area  previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with. he argued closer cooperation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk. if we don't like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to optin or out to suit the british people he said. the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis. the government is employing the politics of confusion  i think deliberately argued mr davis. by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto. on monday tony blair insisted closer cooperation did not mean losing control of british borders. he said an enlarged 25member eu needs a streamlined decision making process. mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out  leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant. he accused the government of being pathetic when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of surrendering on the issue. and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over. mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the best of both worlds and would keep the veto. there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls he said. with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe. mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue. the 25 memberstates are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy in favour of the qualified majority voting qmv system. under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states. britain is expected to retain an optin right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution. if we don't work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours said mr oaten. the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it's right that we don't do this in isolation.,0

blackburn v burnley ewood park tuesday 1 march 2000 gmt howard webb south yorkshire home to leicester in the quarterfinals but defender andy todd is suspended and could be replaced by dominic matteo  if he recovers from a hamstring injury. burnley have major injury concerns over frank sinclair and john mcgreal. michael duff looks set to continue at rightback with john oster in midfield and micah hyde is expected to recover from a knee injury.  blackburn boss mark hughes burnley are resolute and have individual talent but i fully expect us to progress. i thought we were comfortable in the first game and never thought we were under pressure. it's a competition we want to progress in and we are doing okay. if we beat burnley we have a home tie against another lower league club leicester.  burnley boss steve cotterill they will be fresh and we'll be tired. that is an honest opinion but our lads just might be able to get themselves up for one more big game. the atmosphere at the last game was very hot  a good verbal contest. our fans will not need whipping up for this game. i just want them to help us as much as they can in a positive way. key match stats  blackburn rovers against bolton is part two of an east lancashire hotpot that didn't turn out to be that spicy when first staged on a sunday lunchtime the weekend before last and resulted in a scrappy goalless draw.  rovers who are aiming to win the cup for a seventh time in their history and first time in 77 years face another replay against championship opposition after eventually disposing of cardiff at ewood park in the third round. but they've not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the premiership for nine years since ipswich  then in the second tier  defeated them 01 after extra time in a third round replay at ewood park on 16 january 1996. history is on rovers side. when they last met their near neighbours in the fa cup 45 years ago it also required an ewood park replay which the home side won 20 and when they last met in the league rovers did the double. they first won their nationwide division one trip to turf moor 02 four seasons ago and then thrashed the clarets on home soil 50.  manager mark hughes who won the cup four times as a player is aiming to steer rovers into the quarterfinals for the second time in 12 years and first time since the 20002001 season. success here and victory home to leicester in the next round could see rovers in the semifinals without having played premiership opposition.  burnley make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals determined to send blackburn the same way as liverpool in the third round. but having failed to pull off another shock at turf moor it could be that the championship outfit  17 places inferior on the league ladder  have missed their best opportunity. having said that burnley are yet to concede a goal in this cup run.  steve cotterills' clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. that was in the season before last when they disposed of premiership fulham at this fifth round stage.  while blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie burnley have had two league outings away from home drawing 11 at derby and losing 10 at preston. that takes their winless run to four games. the combatants from onetime prosperous mill towns are both founder members of the football league. head to head 16th prem winners six times 13th championship winners once,1
'hitler' row over welsh arts cash an artist critical of welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in russia and germany. shani rhys james is worried that the arts council of wales may be taken over by the welsh assembly government. culture minister alun pugh said it would be crass and ignorant to liken a quango review to hitler's germany. but ms james emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. the future of the arts council of wales has been in question since it was announced that most welsh quangos would eventually be abolished. it was announced last july that three welsh quangos education and training body elwa the wales tourist board and the welsh development agency would be brought under assembly government control. the arts council of wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella. but ms james who won the 30000 jerwood painting prize in 2003 said arts funding should be separate from government. ms james told bbc radio wales it's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways. free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. you need distance you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way. but she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate. she told good morning wales just to put the record straight that business in the paper where it said i likened the government to bolshevik russia or hitler's germany the actual quote i gave was 'it is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'. as we know from past european history i.e. russia and germany in the early 20th century artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'. artists need a free voice to express themselves  they reflect a truth through their own art forms.' she said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in wales. she added it would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. it would set the arts scene back 60 years because i really don't think the government has the expertise. if you have the national assembly taking control i fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs. wales has moved on. it is international now. it is not set back in how green was my valley responding to ms james' criticisms mr pugh said the structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. comparing the welsh assembly government to hitler's germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability. ms james whose father was welsh was born in melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre. she moved to powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near llangadfan. she has won a number of arts prizes including the wales open in 1989 and the mostyn open in 1991.,0

bridge could miss rest of season chelsea leftback wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle. the england international 24 was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners' fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday. we think it's a big injury said jose mourinho whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea's 10 defeat at st james' park. with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes those knocks plus carlo cudicini's red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven ablebodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona but had been promised a game in the carling cup final although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona even though he has few options to replace bridge at leftback. celestine babayaro left the club in january ironically to join newcastle and although gallas has deputised at leftback before he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira usually a rightback is switched to leftback with glen johnson who ended the newcastle game in goal playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridge's injury also means mourinho who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal will not have a specialist senior leftback for the runin to the season. he bridge has no chance of playing against barcelona probably will not play against liverpool in the carling cup final and maybe not for the rest of the season he said. the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see but i won't cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday. shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge's injury. i don't know what happened. he said. it was just a shame. i don't think we even touched each other. by all accounts it's pretty serious. i went into the dressingroom after the game and wished him all the best. mourinho whose team are chasing three trophies has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury.,1
swap offer for pirated windows xp computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones. the firsttime initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with preinstalled copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november. until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones. the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free subject to certain conditions until the end of the year. it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world the company told the bbc news website. in june the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp service pack 2 would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code. the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible. the procedure consists of a series of computer checks collating documents and filling out a witness statement. this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders said alex hilton licence compliance manager at microsoft. the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce. the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way which would allow it to take action against software pirates. microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.,2
protect whistleblowers tuc says the government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces the tuc has said. it said data from employment tribunals suggested 1500 safety whistleblowers had lost their jobs since 1999. some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions it said. the health and safety executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer. the tuc figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue. safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond claimed the union organisation. general secretary brendan barber said it shouldn't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety. mr barber who said the problem is far worse than official statistics show called for a legal system that protects safety whistleblowers. he added that workers who are not in a union as well as casual and migrant workers stand little chance of redress. rory o' neill editor of unionbacked hazards magazine which conducted the research said giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate winwin. death and injuries at work increased last year for the second time since the turn of the century. it would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect. the tuc has called on the government to appoint roving safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections. the health and safety executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer with more worker involvement.,0
opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed serious misgivings about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest. michael howard said he would not back the home secretary's plans for control orders which include home detention. i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat. the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders saying i'm sorry. it is a dilemma but there is only one choice. but mr howard said we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life. he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison  not at home  while they await trial. mr howard said he feared internment without trial creates martyrs and could be a very effective recruiting sergeant for terrorists. his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to enter into constructive discussions with his party to find a better way forward. controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail. home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man known only as c certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4's today programme it's a matter of principle for us that we can't have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals. the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. we think there could be a role for some form of control order  tagging surveillance limitation on use of mobile phones  but not with the home secretary's say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process a judge involved in making those decisions said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges.,0
us peertopeer pirates convicted the first convictions for piracy over peertopeer networks have been handed down in the us. new yorker william trowbridge and texan michael chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software. the two men faced charges following raids in august on suspected pirates by the fbi. the pair face jail terms of up to five years and a 250000 130000 fine. in a statement the us department of justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the direct connect peertopeer network. the piracy group called itself the underground network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. direct connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as coordinating spots for sharers. users would swap files such as films and music by exchanging data over the network. during its investigation fbi agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies 40 software programs 13 games and 178 sound recordings from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. the raids were organised under the umbrella of operation digital gridlock which was aimed at fighting criminal copyright theft on peertopeer networks. in total six raids were carried out in august. five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. the department of justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. they also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. the two men are due to be sentenced on 29 april.,2
celtic make late bid for bellamy newcastle striker craig bellamy is discussing a possible shortterm loan move to celtic bbc sport understands. the welsh striker has rejected a move to birmingham after falling out with magpies manager graeme souness. the toon boss vowed bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against arsenal. celtic are in no position to match birmingham's 6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit bellamy while he considers his future. according to bellamy's agent the player dismissed a permanent move to birmingham. and it is unlikely that newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another premiership club. bellamy was fined two weeks' wages after a live tv interview in which he accused souness of lying following a very public dispute about what position bellamy should play in the side. souness said he can't play for me ever again. he has been a disruptive influence from the minute i walked into this football club. he can't go on television and accuse me of telling lies. chairman freddy shepherd described bellamy's behaviour as totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.,1
mps' murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps' report. the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse. the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor. at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff  the minimum term they must serve  if the defendant pleads guilty. but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. in july this year amanda champion's killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years  it would have been longer had he denied the charge. amanda's uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence. mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing lastminute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty. the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill. as a result says the committee the government may need to relegislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced. it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. lord woolf's sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. as a result murderers who face a 15year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police. mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances. but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals. he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial. shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences  such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime he said. but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news.,0
mp attacked by muggers in kenya an mp has had more than 600 and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in kenya. quentin davies the mp for grantham and stamford was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital nairobi. he was not hurt in the mugging on saturday evening. several people are being questioned over the attack. he was in kenya before travelling to sudan with the parliamentary committee. local police were said to be surprised he was in the area. mr davies 60 said the mugging occurred 100 yards from the nairobi serena hotel and equally close to the anglican cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk. he said in a statement it was a frightening experience. six men managed to steal up on me and grab me from behind. i knew i had to stay very calm and passive  you cannot fight six men. he had to spend an extra 24 hours in nairobi before rejoining the rest of the house of commons international development committee in dafur after the mugging. naturally i was afraid they would use a knife or gun though they never produced any weapon he said. two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets.,0
blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow. these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eyewitness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most wellknown examples include iraqi salam pax's accounts of the usled war former iranian vicepresident mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic's government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these firsthand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews.com launched last november. the blogging movement has been building up for many years. andrew nachison director of the media center a usbased thinktank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says. and blogs were a key part of that transformation. among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio. we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website. but they followed the story they didn't lead it. some parts of the socalled traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs. others like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content. i don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison. however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. the onetomany road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened. and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison. the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't that's gone forever. with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories. it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger. but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the socalled blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels. tools such as google's blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog. us research thinktank pew internet  american life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds although less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months. but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay. we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison. and there's going to be bad that comes with the good.,2
honour for uk games maker leading british computer games maker peter molyneux has been made an obe in the new year honours list. the head of surrey's lionhead studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry. mr molyneux has been behind many of the groundbreaking games of the last 15 years such as populous theme park dungeon keeper and black and white. he is widely credited with helping to create and popularise the socalled godgame genre. speaking to the bbc news website mr molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise. it's come completely out of the blue he said i never would have guessed that i'd have that kind of honour. he said he was surprised as much because not too long ago many people thought computer gaming was a fad. it was thought to be like skateboarding he said a craze that everyone thought would go away. now he said the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence. britain plays a big part in it he said. it's one of the founding nations that made the industry what it is. mr molyneux has been a pivotal figure in the computer games industry for almost 20 years. his career started at bullfrog studios which in 1987 produced populous one of the first godgames. the title gave players control over the lives a small population of computerised people. mr molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career. i thought everyone would treat populous as weird he said but it became a huge international success. he left bullfrog in 1997 to set up lionhead studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game black  white. one of the next titles to come from lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film. the veteran game maker says he has one problem still to solve. being an absolute geek i've got no idea what i'm going to wear when i go and pick it up he said.,2
pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk's biggest miscarriages of justice. the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in 1974. mr blair said i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice. he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television mr blair said the families deserved to be completely and publicly exonerated. the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister's questions in the house of commons. however one of the socalled guildford four gerry conlon  who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs  said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with such sincerity adding he went beyond what we thought he would he took time to listen to everyone. you could see he was moved by what people were saying. tony blair has healed rifts he is helping to heal wounds. it's a day i never thought would come. the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair's official spokesman said noone present at the meeting would ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them. most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon's father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london as well as two family friends. she said it was a wonderful feeling to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october 1989 the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four and in june 1991 it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon's case was highlighted in the oscarnominated film in the name of the father starring daniel daylewis.,0

chepkemei hit by big ban kenya's athletics body has suspended twotime london marathon runnerup susan chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year. athletics kenya ak issued the ban after chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in embu. we have banned her from all local and international competitions said ak chief isaiah kiplagat. we shall communicate this decision to the iaaf and all meet directors all over the world. the 29yearold finished second to paula radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 london races and was also edged out in an epic new york marathon contest last year. but the ban will prevent the twotime world halfmarathon silver medallist from challenging radcliffe at this year's london event in april. global sports communications chepkemei's management company said she had wanted to run in the world cross country championships in march. but ak maintained it was making an example of chepkemei as a warning to other kenyan athletes. we are taking this action in order to salvage our pride said kiplagat. we have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us. ka has also threatened threetime women's shortcourse champion edith masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. masai missed the national trials in early february but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. she failed to run in the event citing a leg injury.,1
minimum rate for foster parents foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs the government has announced. payment levels vary from area to area with some carers getting just 50 a week for clothes food and other costs. minister for children young people and families margaret hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible. however local authorities which set and pay the allowances are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. about 50000 children live with foster families in the uk and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet. ms hodge said foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child  a crucial role in society. we need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity. the government is seeking to amend the children bill which passes through the commons next week to establish a national minimum payment. fostering network executive director robert tapsfield criticised the existing system. there is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. and with a shortage of over 8000 foster carers in england it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets. the charity recommends a weekly payment of 108.49 for looking after a baby. in a survey it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as 100 per week. the association of directors of social services adss said it agreed in principle with the government's plans. tony hunter the organisation's president said there are many devils and lots of details hidden within the government's proposals. but adss fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.,0
juninho demand for o'neill talks juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with martin o'neill as the brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing celtic. brian hassell says no official approach has been received from manchester city but that the english club had been earmarked as a possible destination. but it was being stressed to bbc sport that juninho would prefer to remain with the scottish champions. juninho wants assurances that he will return to o'neill's firstteam plans. he has become frustrated with his lack of firstteam action since his move from middlesbrough in the summer. hassel says juninho who has just bought a new home would desperately like to stay at celtic but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted. the agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30yearold's father being in scotland and talk of a move back to botafogo in brazil. juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. i know there is interest from a brazilian club but i know juninho doesn't want to go there said hassel. he wants to stay in britain. in fact he wants to stay at celtic. hassall made it clear that a move to manchester city who are badly in need of a midfield playmaker was more of a possibility than botafogo or mexican outfit red sharks veracruz who also expressed an interest. it was a thought at one stage he said. if you are not going to get a game under one manager you look for another whose style of play suits you. he is a fan of kevin keegan's style of play. it would not be a bad move for him. juninho had earlier told the daily record the manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. if that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. that would be good for the club and good for me. if i have no part in his plans there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes. the attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss martin o'neill since his move to celtic park. i can't understand why i am in this situation he continued. when a manager brings a new player to the club he gives that player support.,1
what highdefinition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment  highdefinition. highdefinition gives incredible 3dlike pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when highdefinition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a highdefinition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones. there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website. the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says. but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as highdefinition films demand. as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains. i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the highdef world and i find it very exciting. highdefinition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch highdefinition dvds in 18 months' time. mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd highdefinition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference. i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen. highdefinition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole producing films for highdefinition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd. when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second says mr dean. our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. that's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied  about 98. so if you have anything that allows more space you don't have to compress so hard. studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto highcapacity dvds. currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean. although the step of downconverting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day's work says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay. if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required. and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a highdefinition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean. highdefinition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very suntanned but that was makeup. in the hd version of episode i all these makeup lines showed up explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too. there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn't see it. what highdefinition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen. in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol  broadband giving a dvdlike experience from the settop box to the hard drive says mr dean. but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.,2
collins named uk athletics chief uk athletics has ended its search for a new performance director by appointing psychologist dave collins. collins who worked with the british teams at the 2000 and 2004 olympics takes over from max jones. six candidates were interviewed for the job including denise lewis' coach charles van commenee and former british triple jumper keith connor. we've searched long and hard to ensure we have found the right person said uka chief executive david moorcroft. we have thoroughly tested the candidates. i believe david will make a great leader and i have great faith in what he will achieve. collins said it's a great challenge. over the next few months i will spend time listening to those who already make a significant contribution to athletics and other elite sports in the uk. collins who has worked with javelin thrower steve backley in the past started his career as a royal marine before becoming a pe teacher. he is currently professor of physical education and sport performance at edinburgh university where he helps competitors across many sports including rugby athletics judo and football. he has specialised in helping competitors fulfil their potential through psychology and has worked with the great britain women's curling team who won gold at the 2002 winter olympics. mark lewisfrancis sought collins' advice in athens when he was looking for inspiration before he ran the final leg of britain's surprise triumph in the 4x100m relay. collins has played rugby at regional level was captain of the great britain american football team and competed at national level in judo and karate. he arrives with british athletics at a crossroads. despite kelly holmes' golden double and the success of the sprint relay squad the gb team failed to live up to expectations in athens. many older competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers and britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in italy this year. collins will not have daytoday coaching contact with the athletes but will be expected to make changes to the system and coaching setup in order to secure medals at the beijing olympics in 2008. the appointment of a new performance director was one of the main recommendations in sir andrew foster's review of the sport which was published in may. it was commissioned by uk sport and sport england which wanted uk athletics to justify funding of more than 40m from the government following the failure to hang on to the 2005 world championships which are now being held in helsinki. van commenee dropped out of the selection process to take on the same role with the dutch olympic committee while connor's application was rejected after an arduous interview process. foster however declared himself satisfied with how the appointment was made. the appointment of david collins with his strong mix of leadership skills and managerial experience is testament to the professional and detailed recruitment process he said.,1
wada will appeal against ruling the world antidoping agency wada will appeal against the acquittal of kostas kenteris and katerina thanou on doping charges if the iaaf does not. the pair were cleared of charges relating to missing dope tests by the greek athletics federation last week. wada chairman dick pound said i am convinced the iaaf will appeal against the decision and we will support them. but if they accept the federation's ruling we will go before the court of arbitration for sport he added. kenteris's lawyer gregory ioannidis reacted angrily to pound's comments. comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies create a hostage situation for the iaaf and strengthen our case further he told bbc sport. kenteris 31 and thanou 30 had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify antidoping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics. they withdrew from the athens games after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august. but an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in athens. however their former coach christos tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal. kenteris and thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking a motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the athens games.,1
brizzel to run aaa's in sheffield ballymena sprinter paul brizzel will be among eight of ireland's european indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend's aaa's championships. usbased alistair cragg and mark carroll are the only irish athletes selected so far for the europeans who will not run in sheffield. brizzel will defend his 200m title in the british trials. inform james mcilroy will hope to confirm his place in the british team for madrid by winning the 800m title. mcilroy has been in tremendous form on the european circuit in recent weeks. he is one of the fastest 800m runners in the world this winter and already seems assured of a place in madrid. corkman mark carroll confirmed in midweek that he would join cragg in the european championships. carroll is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with cragg occupying top spot. meanwhile ninetimes champion dermot donnelly will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the northern ireland cross country championships in coleraine on saturday. an injury crisis in the annadale striders squad led to donnelly being entered by coach john mclaughlin but the athlete told bbc sport on friday evening that he would not be running. willowfield's paul rowan will go in as individual favourite but annadale could have a tough job holding on to their team title as andrew dunwoody and noel pollock are unlikely to run.,1
warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. the link to the website is contained in a spam email that is currently circulating. the message's subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam emails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania. ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web. dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. bt and dec's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said. ms sanders said sending out spam email to solicit donations was not dec's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed. none of the email addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. one email sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands. the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud emails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. other scam emails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. in a monthly report antivirus firm sophos said that two email messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during january. another tsunamirelated email is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft's outlook email program. anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to.,2
howard attacks cost of asylum michael howard has launched an attack on the cost of britain's chaotic asylum system under tony blair. the tory leader said english local authorities have spent more than 3bn  or 140 per household  on asylum since labour won power in 1997. mr howard is expected to tell activists in kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked tory plans for annual limits on numbers. mr howard said britain should take its fair share of the world's genuine refugees. the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz  where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others  has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution he was due to say. but if we are to fulfil responsibility we have to get a grip of the system. fair play matters. people want a government that upholds the rules  not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused he said. and let's be clear. our asylum system is being abused  and with it britain's generosity. earlier this week mr howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. if elected his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. that prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. if we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution then these policies will not provide a safe haven said hannah ward of the refugee council. if people turn up in the uk asking for help they will be turned away. michael howard's policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the uk. when it comes to costs then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. so many of them are shown to be wrong  one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned rising to half for some nationalities. we need good quality decisionmaking on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much. tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans. by cutting the number of frontline immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. on monday mr howard said it's not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it.,0
verdict delay for greek sprinters greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters costas kenteris and katerina thanou for missing doping tests. the pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests including one on the eve of last year's athens olympics. they were set to learn their fate by the end of february but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. a decision is now expected by around midmarch said one of their lawyers michalis dimitrakopoulos. kenteris 31 who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 sydney games and thanou 30 who won the women's 100m silver medal in sydney face a maximum twoyear ban if found guilty. the athletes who spectacularly withdrew from the athens olympics have been suspended by the international association of athletics federations iaaf for missing the three tests. the iaaf said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and ordered greek athletic's governing body segas to hold a disciplinary inquiry. the athletes also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the athens test which led to them spending four days in hospital. following the final hearing in late january the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. i am confident and optimistic thanou had said at the time. we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of. it was not clear what this new evidence was.,1
kenteris denies faking road crash greek sprinter kostas kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the olympics. kenteris and fellow sprinter katerina thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week. part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. kenteris insisted the accident happened. i went crazy when i found out i had supposedly missed a test and i wanted to rush to the olympic village. kenteris speaking on greece's alter television station also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. i told the hospital which was an olympicsaccredited hospital to call the ioc and have me tested on the spot but noone came. after a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in greece as athens prepared for the start of the athens games kenteris and thanou eventually withdrew. but kenteris has continually protested his innocence  and on sunday blamed greek olympic committee officials and his former coach christos tzekos for failing to inform him of the test. the 31yearold insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name. if a decision is taken to have charges filed against me i will accept it gladly. a prosecution means that the case will be cleared... i want to go to the end and then we'll see who's right and who isn't. kenteris a greek hero after winning gold in the 200m at the 2000 olympics in sydney also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the athens opening ceremony. i had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron he said.,1
kennedy calls for iraq exit plans tony blair should set out a proper exit strategy from iraq in the wake of next sunday's elections in the country lib dem leader charles kennedy has said. in a speech focusing on issues arising from the reelection of george w bush mr kennedy said iraq had become a crucible of militant terrorism. he wants to see a phased withdrawal of uk troops as soon as the situation allows he said in london. any exit strategy must augment and support the democratic process. there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency he said. there is some truth in that especially after the initial mistakes that were made  the heavyhandedness of operations like fallujah and the wellpublicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces. mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands portugal and the czech republic which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq have announced their imminent withdrawal regardless of the situation on the ground. he accused mr blair's government of being less than straightforward over its plans. next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in iraq mr kennedy said during his city of london speech. he should set out a proper exit strategy including the phased withdrawal of british troops as the security situation allows. mr kennedy also argued that british troops deployed in iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries  especially islamic countries.,0
jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee. ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories. jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performanceenhancing drugs before the sydney olympics. but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge. any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc's executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing. the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world antidoping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now. we will find a way to deal with that pound said. in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. victor conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said. conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements.,1
police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently police chiefs have told mps. association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox's comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics' calls for the law change to be delayed. instead the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder  but only if it was properly planned he argued. acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact. if it's 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there's not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn't open on sunday anyway. this is about getting through to the management that they can't run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions. under acpo's proposal the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs  but only for 24hour periods. mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself. it's making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse and the strategic planning process has been less than useless he said. mr fox said the new laws due to start being phased in next month could help if food outlets public transport and public toilets could cope with latenight drinkers. staggering it closing hours will be a solution if the infrastructure is there if the premises are properly managed and people aren't being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street he said. we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this. acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. it was the status quo not the new laws which were causing current binge drinking problems she told bbc two's newsnight. leaked documents have suggested exhome secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a leap in the dark. but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met. the police's job against alcoholrelated crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time she added.,0
multipurpose tv aids india twothirds of the world's population 4 billion people live on 2000 a year or less. you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. but that's not the case. many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv. and now an indianborn computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. i come from a village says prof reddy i know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns. there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc word processing and powerpoint he said. so it's clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village  it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice. prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. after all he asked  what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market. the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says. people do this today with television sets. if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. why because personalized entertainment has become very important. this hatched a completely new idea. he calls it a pctvt  a personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control. on the screen pictures  not words  designate applications like tv voice mail and video email. this dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd. prassana rambathla one of prof reddy's graduate students says that when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' it can't choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing. the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says. the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have builtin audio and video hardware and software. limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh. although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley. the answer says prof brewer is wifi. we're looking at the thing you'll see in starbuck's or many other hotspots he says. we're doing a lot of work on longdistance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason. prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about 10 a month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities. reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt's other technologies  such as video mail. for example a farmer could use the pctvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real payoff. the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care.' and what i'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. if i didn't have it it would be an uphill battle. even with the technology it's an uphill battle. but i have a tool. there is hope. i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction,2
'noone can define new hunt ban' the new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted noone can define the offence prohunt mps say. the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm. because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting  chasing away  and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules. north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group of which mr opik is a cochairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry defra. he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act. mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence  prompting him to complain. the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra's lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence. mr opik said hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act. now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting  'chasing away' which isn't even covered by the act. however all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away tory mp peter luff another cochairman of middle way said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence. it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. however i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating. mike hobday of the league against cruel sports said there is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense. if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence. if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting.,0
thanou bullish over drugs hearing katerina thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter kostas kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the athens olympics. the greek pair appeared at a hearing on saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics' ruling body the iaaf should stand. after five months we finally had the chance to give explanations. i am confident and optimistic said thanou. we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of. the athletes' lawyer grigoris ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the greek athletics federation segas would find them innocent. we are almost certain that the charges will be dropped said ioanidis. we believe that we have presented a case that the charges are unreasonable. thanou the 2000 olympic women's 100m silver medallist and sydney 200m champion kenteris were suspended by the iaaf for missing three drugs tests. the third was supposed to take place on the eve of the athens games last august but the pair could not be found in the athletes' village. they were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. thanou's coach christos tzekos was also suspended by the iaaf. we were asked by the disciplinary committee all kinds of questions about the night of 12 august said tzekos. we did not leave any gaps. as far as i am concerned there is no such issue of refusing to be tested and i am very optimistic. tzekos thanou and kenteris who have all denied the charges can expect a decision within a month. deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by thursday said committee chairman kostas panagopoulos. i estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of february.,1
greek sprinters 'won't run again' the careers of sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are over says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test. greek athletics federation boss vassilli sevastis told the country's parliament i believe kenteris and thanou won't race again. the damage to their commercial interests has been done he added. athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling while the athletes face a trial in a greek court. greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident. speaking to the greek parliament on tuesday sevastis said that the evidence sent by the international olympic committee and athletics governing body the iaaf was not strong enough for the greek association to find the sprinters guilty. we were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with he said. so how can you as a greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes he added. the athletes are technically free to compete while the iaaf reviews its response to the decision to clear kenteris and thanou. but sevastis said it does not matter if they are found guilty at the court of arbitration for sport and the current decision is reversed.,1
yahoo celebrates a decade online yahoo one of the net's most iconic companies is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week. the web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by stanford university students david filo and jerry yang in a campus trailer. the students wanted a way of keeping track of their webbased interests. the categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea. originally dubbed jerry's guide to the world wide web the firm adopted the moniker yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude unsophisticated uncouth person. the term was popularised by the 18th century satirist jonathan swift in his classic novel gulliver's travels. we were certainly not sophisticated or civilised mr yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary which will be officially recognised on 2 march. they did have business brains however and in april 1995 persuaded venture capitalists sequoia capital which also invested in apple computer and cisco systems to fund yahoo to the tune of 2m 1.04m. a second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in april 1996 with less than 50 employees. now the firm employs 7600 workers and insists its dot com culture of work hard play hard still remains. it is one of just a handful of survivors of the dotcom crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as google msn and aol. jerry yang who remains the firm's chief yahoo is proud of what the company has achieved. in just one decade the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything  and it's been a remarkable and wonderful experience he said. through it all we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs but it's even more than that  it's to help every one of us to discover get more done share and interact.,2
gadget market 'to grow in 2005' the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005 delegates at the world's largest gadget show in las vegas have been told. the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11 while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. everything is going digital kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show ces featured the pick of 2005's products. consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs highdefinition tvs digital radio and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry. despite showing diversity some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much wow factor as in previous years. the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces which was the time and place shifting of multimedia content  being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere at any time. at the start of last year's ces the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4 in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the generation xers who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57 of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers according to cea research. hybrid devices which combine a number of multimedia functions were also in evidence on the show floor. a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it said stephen baker a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group. some of these functions cost next to nothing to add. as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant highdefinition tvs several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate's preshow speech he announced several new partnerships  mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some however by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony's new portable games device the psp had at the show. sony said the muchanticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their consumer technology offering. elsewhere at the show there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens including samsung's 102inch 2.6 metre plasma  the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about highdefinition technologies coming to the fore in 2005 with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage like seagate's 5gb pocket sized external hard drive which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.,2
blind student 'hears in colour' a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps. victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website. for the sake of my own study  and for the sake of blind scientists generally  i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images. he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels  ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn't work that well. mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour's getting redder and redder and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears. the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.,2
tory leader urges harry apology prince harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a nazi uniform to a friend's fancy dress party says tory leader michael howard. mr howard whose grandmother died in auschwitz said many people would be offended by the prince's actions clarence house has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume. number 10 said an error was made but now harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace. that was a message repeated by home secretary charles clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie. but lib dem leader charles kennedy said harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. there is a reservoir of goodwill for prince harry and prince william with him in this country but i think he needs to remember that it can't last forever. he added that sandhurst would probably be good for harry as it would teach him some self discipline. former labour mp lord janner who is a high profile member of britain's jewish community branded harry's action's stupid and evil. he told itv the time has come for him to make a public apology. it is about common decency of respect to the people who fought the nazis to the families of those who were killed by the nazis and to people who suffered during the holocaust. he added i would send him in the army as fast as possible. i hope that would teach him not to behave like that. a photograph of prince harry wearing a swastika armband and german desert uniform at the party appears in thursday's sun newspaper under the headline harry the nazi. mr howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. but he told bbc radio 4's today programme it might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is. mr howard declined to say what form the statement should take. but former buckingham palace press spokesman dicky arbiter said the prince should make a personal broadcast apology. mr clarke said he recognised people's concerns about the costume but argued he has apologised and i think we should leave the matter there.,0
uk 'needs true immigration data' a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration. barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. she said this would counter socalled independent groups like migration watch which she described as an antiimmigration body posing as independent. migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. sir andrew green chairman of the organisation says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate. he says he opposes largescale immigration both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture. he said for example over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france. ms roche labour mp for hornsey and wood green believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean we wouldn't have socalled independent experts like migration watch who come into this debate from an antiimmigration point of view. she went on what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures published them and was independent of government. i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.,0
howard unveils election platform the conservatives would stand up for the forgotten majority michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto. the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values. in the foreword to the manifesto he promises to focus on restoring order trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. labour says the document offers only a return to a failed tory past. the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a threeparty contest. campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june 2006. labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto. other chapters will follow in coming weeks. in a speech in northamptonshire he said the forgotten majority made up the backbone of britain. they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement working hard and accepting their responsibilities. he says in the manifesto foreword they have been forgotten neglected and taken for granted by mr blair. saying britain must change direction mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue down the path of ever rising taxes. he promises to ensure frontline professionals parents and patients make the key decisions rather than whitehall bureaucrats. and he says the tories would get a grip on crime immigration and disorder. the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of socalled 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder he says. mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options not specific plans. mr howard told bbc news i'm determined to lower taxes but i'm also determined not to make any promises i can't keep. the tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies he said. he was asked if tory support for the government on iraq and identity cards had given the lib dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to labour. mr howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for britain. it had nothing to do with putting clear blue water between himself and his opponents. labour's election slogan will be britain's working don't let the tories wreck it again. campaign coordinator alan milburn accused the tories of launching thatcherism in instalments while labour helped the hard working majority of families. lib dem president simon hughes said his party had set out its election stance in september. the liberal democrats will ask the british people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust he said.,0
chelsea denied by james heroics a brave defensive display led by keeper david james helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea. after a quiet opening james denied damien duff jiri jarosik and mateja kezman while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas' header off the line. robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard's freekick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season. and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea  deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury  struggled to pose much of a threat. indeed it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. shaun wrightphillips  watched by england boss svengoran eriksson  showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball which was blocked by john terry. but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. first duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman who turned the ball wide. soon afterwards jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard's corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over. chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman's fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas' header from duff's corner. city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal. wrightphillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city's lone man up front left free by terry's slip contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. the second half started as quietly as the first although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen's path. there was a nasty moment for petr cech looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper. another quiet spell followed which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt. lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs. another timely challenge this time from richard dunne in time added on prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard's volley round the post. cech paulo ferreira gallas terry bridge jarosik tiago 56 lampard makelele duff gudjohnsen kezman cole 63. subs not used johnson smertin cudicini. makelele gudjohnsen. james mills distin dunne thatcher shaun wrightphillips bosvelt barton sibierski mcmanaman 85 musampa fowler. subs not used macken weaver onuoha jordan. bosvelt. 42093 h webb s yorkshire.,1
slimmer playstation triple sales sony playstation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers with 50000 sold in its first week on sale. sales have tripled since launch outstripping microsoft's xbox said market analysts charttrack. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2only game grand theft auto san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677000 copies. it is obviously very very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week john houlihan editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news. and with halo 2 for xbox out next week it really is a headtohead contest between them and xbox. although xbox sales over the last week also climbed ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburghbased developer rockstar which is behind the gta titles has seen san andreas pull in an estimated 24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took 11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings the return of the king took nearly 10m over its opening weekend although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. gangsterthemed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastestselling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2 released on 11 november in the uk is also widely tipped to be one of the bestselling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001 and sold more than four million copies. mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2 but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the runup to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft's xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. both have hit crucial price points at around 100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales said mr houlihan.,2
no half measures with halflife 2 could halflife 2 possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highlyanticipated computer game of all time. fortunately it doesn't merely live up to its promise but exceeds it. noone who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money  or indeed time  is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 halflife. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monsterinfested research facility he's back in another foreboding troublespot  the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station it's clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be. you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedomfighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out stepbystep is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cutscenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you. whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a topnotch theme park thrillride wandering through halflife's world truly does feel like being part of a movie. considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components this is it. on our test machine  an alienware system with an athlon 3500 processor and ati's radeon x800 video card  everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jawdropping. it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause midtask and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow. virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attentiontodetail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times halflife 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombiesleapingoutofshadows approach of doom iii it's all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside. the game does have a couple of problems. firstly the carefullyscripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people. a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. if you like things openended and freeranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a lifedraining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this antipiracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances  but luckily halflife 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will feel of any genre. the bar has been raised and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future. halflife 2 is out now for the pc,2
holmes back on form in birmingham double olympic champion kelly holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the 1000m at the norwich union birmingham indoor grand prix. the 34yearold running only her second competitive race of the season shook off the rust to win in two minutes 35.39 seconds. but she is still undecided about competing in the european championships in madrid from 46 march. i'll probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute she said. my training hasn't gone as well as expected but i've got two weeks to decide. i need to take my time and make sure i feel good about what i'm doing. i felt very good here but with the crowd behind you you feel like you can do anything. american was the eventual winner of the men's 60m race which almost ended in farce. three athletes were disqualified for false starting including britain's mark lewisfrancis who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly. world 100m champion kim collins clinched second spot ahead of world 60m record holder and scott's training partner maurice greene. jason gardener's unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his european title in madrid. you can't win them all said gardener afterwards. and i was very disappointed as i know i'm capable of doing better. russian was back on recordbreaking form in the pole vault at the national indoor arena. the olympic champion set a new world mark of 4.88m to break her own record  which she set just six days ago  and beat russian rival svetlana feofanova. it was isinbayeva's 11th world record  indoors or out  since july 2003. i'm so happy and i will do my best to break the 5m barrier soon the 22yearold told bbc sport. jamaica's stormed to a personal best of 7.13 seconds to claim the women's 60m sprint. belgian kim gevaert who will be one of the favourites for next month's european title took second while american muna lee was third. there was disappointment for british pair jeanette kwakye and joice maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively. jamaican stretched her unbeaten record to 25 races as she effortlessly claimed the 200m. the olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of 22.38 seconds  the fastest time in the world this season. fought off fellow briton tim abeyie to take the men's 200m in a personal best of 20.88. continued her outstanding start to the season beating a strong international field which included twotime olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist melissa morrison to claim the women's 60m hurdles. the 25yearold briton clocked 7.98 seconds while preeuropean championships favourite russian irina shevchenko finished down in sixth. ethiopia's failed in her bid to smash compatriot berhane adere's world 3000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. the olympic 5000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third finishing in eight minutes 33.05 seconds  the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. britain's jo pavey bravely decided to go with defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a season's best 841.43. kenyan also missed out on the indoor 1500m world record which hicham el guerrouj has held for the last eight years. lagat settled for silver behind el guerrouj in athens and was almost four seconds short of the moroccan's world best clocking 335.27 in birmingham. and was still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year. the olympic 10000m champion had comfortably led the men's two mile race after his younger brother tariku had set the pace. but fellow ethiopian appeared ominously on bekele's shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in 814.28. jamaican made the most of a blistering start to take the men's 400m title in 45.91 seconds. world indoor champion alleyne francique faded badly and finished in fourth while american duo jerry harris and james davis took second and third respectively. swede showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from jade johnson with the very last jump of the competition. the olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached 6.66m to better johnson's mark of 6.52m  her second personal best inside a week. i was quite surprised because i didn't think i'd end up with second place said johnson who wore london's 2012 olympic bid slogan back the bid on her shorts. but i'm pleased and hopefully i'll get a bit better for the europeans. i really want to win a medal. won the men's event with a season's best of 7.95m taking the scalp of world indoor champion savante stringfellow of the usa.,1
rush future at chester uncertain ian rush's future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused a severance package. chester have won only two of their last 10 league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the 43yearold liverpool legend. vaughan said i offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them. i haven't because of the finances so technically they're still employees. vaughan claimed that aizlewood had verbally agreed to the offer. but the chester chairman added after they discussed the offer with their solicitor who also acts as their agent they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement which was disappointing. rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool teammate mark wright who guided chester to the conference title last season. chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the managerofthemonth award for october. chester's downturn in form culminated in a 50 defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone.,1
wenger handed summer war chest arsenal boss arsene wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer. the club's managing director keith edelman stressed that the development of their new 350m stadium had no affect on wenger's spending power. the money is there. don't worry we've got it edelman told bbc sport. hopefully we'll spend it this summer and in the coming years. arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong. edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. its great to have nice new surroundings but if the team aren't performing on the pitch then there isn't great respect in having a fabulous stadium he said. it's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place before we began on the stadium.,1
child access laws shakeup parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers' activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong. between 15000 and 20000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention. lord falconer told bbc radio 4's today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include  parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on reallife examples that have worked in the past  extending incourt conciliation  more informal hearings before contested court cases  better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet  legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews. failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said tagging may be going too far but let's have a debate about that. full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said. the government's proposals have met with disapproval from fathers' rights groups. john ison from the controversial group fathers 4 justice said it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation. jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion. we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order  then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is. otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart. mr parton said he had been told by children's minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may. the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio 4's today programme that the government's plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system. she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of coparenting and compulsory mediation. we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets.,0
labour accused of broken pledge labour has already broken its preelection promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card the tories have claimed. home secretary charles clarke has been quoted as telling labour members he wants more migrants to come to the uk. tory cochairman liam fox said the comments were at odds with tony blair's prediction of a net cut in immigration. but mr clarke accused him of trying to score cheap political points by muddling immigration with asylum. london's evening standard quoted mr clarke telling labour activists at a question and answer session in gateshead that he wanted britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. that's not only a moral duty and a legal duty but something which is part of the essence of this country he said. we want more migration more people come to study and to work. we want more people coming to look for refuge. mr blair's was asked last wednesday if the government's new immigration plans including a point system for economic migrants would reduce net migration. the prime minister told mps the abusers will be weeded out and as a result of the end of chain migration where families have an automatic right to settle the numbers will probably fall. on monday dr fox told reporters the prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week. the labour party election pledges even when they are so incredibly vague do not even last four days. the tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants. mr clarke dismissed the latest tory attack. this is simply a scurrilous attempt by the tories to score cheap political points he said. the tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum. mr clarke said he had made clear the uk would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system. and only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted. under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall he added. earlier dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about tory policies and then attacking the lies. he told bbc radio if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all. the latest preelection spats come after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda which would take britain backwards. lib dem leader charles kennedy accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay.,0
howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas. mr howard whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk says the claim would mean noone from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called 'no more mr nasty'. tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would like to kick your cat. ms robinson a friend of the tory leader also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  although she denied having personal experience. i wasn't at cambridge  and it's not personal experience  but i know people who were. documentary maker michael cockerell was given behindthescenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s his parents might not have been allowed into the country. he replies what is the inference of that that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister. ms robinson who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major's government. i used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very very draconian. the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner's impression of him as dracula which he calls good fun apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife exmodel sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses yeah it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too but otherwise it's quite fun. former downing street communications chief alastair campbell now working on labour's election campaign says a touchyfeely image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a big strategy including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as absolutely rubbish arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is conceivable it could win the next election. but he adds it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.  michael howard no more mr nasty is being shown on bbc2 on saturday 12 february at 2005 gmt.,0
labour chooses manchester the labour party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool it has been confirmed. the much trailed decision was ratified by labour's ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. it will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event. blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move. for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool bournemouth and brighton. and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. in 1998 the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in 2002. the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference. colin asplin blackpool hotel association said we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool. obviously we have failed in that. i just hope manchester can handle the crowds. it amazes me that the labour party which is a working class party doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country. the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement.,0
new browser wins over net surfers the proportion of surfers using microsoft's internet explorer ie has dropped to below 90 say web analysts. net traffic monitor onestat.com has reported that the opensource browser firefox 1.0 released on 9 november seems to be drawing users away from ie. while ie's market share has dropped 5 since may to 88.9 mozilla browsers  including firefox  have grown by 5. firefox is made by the mozilla foundation which was set up by former browser maker netscape in 1998. although there have been other preview versions of firefox version 1.0 was the first complete official program. it seems that people are switching from microsoft's internet explorer to mozilla's new firefox browser said niels brinkman cofounder of amsterdambased onestat.com. mozilla browsers  including firefox 1.0  now have 7.4 of the market share the figures suggest. mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release. supporters of the opensource software in the us managed to raise 250000 133000 to advertise the release of firefox 1.0 in the new york times and support the mozilla foundation. there was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release. the figures echo similar research from net analyst websidestory which suggested that ie had 92.9 of users in october compared to 95.5 in june. microsoft ie has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from netscape and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95 mark. firefox is attractive to many because it is opensource. that means people are free to adapt the software's core code to create other innovative features like addons or extensions to the program. fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in firefox than in ie. paul randle microsoft windows client product manager responded to the figures we certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features. microsoft continues to make significant investments in ie including service pack 2 with advanced security technologies and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party addons for internet explorer. firefox wants to capture 10 of the market by the end of 2005. other browser software like opera and apple's safari are also challenging microsoft's grip on the browser market. opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year. onestat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net users in 100 countries.,2
greek duo cleared in doping case sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal. the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests including one on the eve of the athens olympics. but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans  a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport. the pair's former coach christos tzekos has been banned for four years. kenteris 31 and thanou 30 had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify antidoping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics. they withdrew from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august. the pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee's demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal. the head of that tribunal kostas panagopoulos said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens. the charge cannot be substantiated he said. in no way was he kenteris informed to appear for a doping test. the same goes for thanou. kenteris's lawyer gregory ioannidis said the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career. he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january. this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one. it shows he has no case to answer. mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character. he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures. but the iaaf said it was very surprised by the verdict. spokesman nick davies said we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest. our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision.,1
pandas benefit from wireless net the world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network. the wolong nature reserve in the sichuan province of southwest china is home to 20 of the remaining 1500 giant pandas in the world. a broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. the data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. the reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology. using the network vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival. digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside wolong and with the rest of the world said zhang hemin director of the wolong nature reserve. our researchers now have stateoftheart digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings. the network has been developed by intel working closely with the staff at wolong. it includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock. before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. to foster cultural links across the globe a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network in collaboration with globio federation for global biodiversity education for children an international nonprofit organisation. it will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in portland oregon in the us. digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world said globio founder gerry ellis.,2
antiterror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament. tories lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges not politicians should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday's vote in the commons but faces a battle in the house of lords. the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes control orders which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases and curfews electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects. the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the sayso of the home secretary rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice like the guildford four  for which tony blair recently apologised  as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach he told bbc radio 4's today programme. mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now  even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london's belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules  and which are due to expire on 14 march. the new powers designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords' concerns would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days  wednesday and next monday  to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently. in a rare move the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill saying the house arrest plans are excessive. it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today it gives a minister for the first time in modern history the right to detain without trial without showing the evidence and indeed in some respects almost the allegation against the individual concerned. he questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions not politicians. mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests he argued.,0
uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death. home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison london and woodhill milton keynes was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria tunisia egypt and jordan. the government was told that using antiterror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws. mr clarke told the times i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come. he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw in a very positive way. mr clarke said that he was seeking memorandums of understanding between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however he added i do not think the solution to the law lords' judgement for this government is in deportations but they will help. there are other strands that we have to do. but the liberal democrat's shadow home secretary mark oaten accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees. the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future he told bbc news. and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing for example intercept communications telephone tapping to be included mr oaten said. deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country. unless we get that the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march. the bbc's home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult. some of these people are accused of very very serious crimes in their home countries so it's not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won't be the solution. daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions  such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process  in the next few weeks. the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial he said.,0
california sets fines for spyware the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california. from 1 january a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. the legislation which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year. the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. at its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers. the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate. one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's websurfing. it can result in people being bombarded with popup ads that are hard to close. in washington congress has been debating four antispyware bills but california is a step ahead. the state's consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. consumers are able to seek up to 1000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90 of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and adaware.,2

van nistelrooy set to return manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy may make his comeback after an achilles tendon injury in the fa cup fifth round tie at everton on saturday. he has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the champions league tie with ac milan on 23 february. but manchester united manager sir alex ferguson hinted he may be back early. he said there is a chance he could be involved at everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training. the 28yearold has been training in holland and ferguson said ruud comes back on tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. the training he has been doing in holland has been perfect and i am very satisfied with it. even without van nistelrooy united made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 20 derby victory at manchester city on sunday. but they will be boosted by the return of the dutch international who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. he has not played since aggravating the injury in the 30 win against west brom on 27 november. ferguson was unhappy with van nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. united have also been hit by injuries to both alan smith and louis saha during van nistelrooy's absence meaning wayne rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. the teenager has responded with six goals in nine games including the first goal against city on sunday.,1

benitez joy as reds take control liverpool boss rafael benitez was satisfied after his team's 31 win over bayer leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute. before the game if you had said the score will be 31 i would have happily accepted that said benitez. but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level. i have confidence that we can complete the task in germany. i am always confident and we must be positive. benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov's weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game  and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg. for me it was not jerzy dudek's fault added benitez. he had played a very good game  and had we scored our other chances nobody would be talking about about their goal. it would not have mattered. if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. in my opinion jerzy played well made two very fine saves  and i am happy with him. if we lose 20 we are out but i think we can score in germany  certainly one and that will make all the difference. and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard who was suspended for the anfield leg back for the return in germany. steven gerrard is a key player for us said benitez. when he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better  and the opposition pay special attention to him  which gives space for others. steven is one of the best players in the world but i need a team that is not about just one player. there must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well.,1
ban hits halflife 2 pirates hard about 20000 people have been banned from playing the halflife 2 game. game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of halflife 2 had been circulating on filesharing systems soon after it was officially released. experts said the success of the halflife 2 antipiracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version. halflife 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the longawaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run. in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain halflife 2 read the statement. valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20000 represented. one effect of steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten. even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts. valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts. some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account. some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve's antipiracy actions. in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake halflife 2 keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false. the company said the hack came from the 'community' as do they all. it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of halflife 2 circulating on fileswapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys. rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system. before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of halflife 2 he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. it's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said. this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steamtype systems that are used to batter people with adverts. unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.,2
hague 'given up' his pm ambition former conservative leader william hague says he will not stand for the leadership again having given up his ambition to be prime minister. mr hague 43 told the daily telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too boring and unfulfilling. mr hague who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat does not rule out a return to the front bench. he also told the paper he hopes to remain mp for richmond north yorks and start a family with wife ffion. mr hague who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger also said he wanted to continue writing books and speechwriting. he told the newspaper i don't know whether i will ever go back on to the front but don't rush me. asked if he would stand for the leadership again mr hague replied no. definitely not. his determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior conservative members who say the party needs him. tim collins the shadow education secretary said last week it would be a huge boost to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench. mr hague became an mp at 27 and leader of the opposition at 36. he said i feel fortunate that by the age of 40 i had crammed in an entire political career. i had been in the cabinet and been leader of the party so now i can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling. mr hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. maybe i wasn't as driven by politics as i thought i was he said.,0
iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich's champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday. the german club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury. iran refuses to recognise israel's right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition. he's got back pain and he couldn't train the spokesman said. it would have made no sense for him to go. iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili a 125000 reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics. the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.,1

boris opposes mayor apology ken livingstone should stick to his guns and not apologise for his nazi comment to a jewish reporter tory mp boris johnson has insisted. mr johnson also claimed tony blair's intervention in the row was an attempt to reassure jewish voters. london mayor mr livingstone says he is standing by his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a concentration camp guard. but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry. labour's mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked. later the prime minister said a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time but in the circumstances and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist yes he should apologise. however mr johnson who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley said mr blair should butt out of the row. i don't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this the spectator editor told bbc radio 4's today programme. it's a dispute between ken livingstone and a reporter on the evening standard. mr johnson mp for henleyonthames oxfordshire said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war. ken doesn't think he's got anything to say sorry for and if that's really his feeling then i think that he should stick to his guns he said. mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an outdated stereotype of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley. the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. mr johnson told today it's perfectly true that i got into the grovelling game myself and when i apologised there were some things that i felt i ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things i didn't think i should apologise for he said. but here's old ken  he's been crass he's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language  but i don't think actually if you read what he said although it was extraordinary and rude i don't think he was actually antisemitic.,0
broadband in the uk growing fast highspeed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever. bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe. according to figures gathered by industry watchdog ofcom the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that resell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl  the uk's most widely used way of getting broadband  beyond 6km. asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps though faster connections are available. this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pentup demand that existed in many areas said paul reynolds chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms resell. bt retail which sells net services under its own name also had a good quarter and provided about 30 of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition and dwindling influence in other sectors. local loop unbundling llu in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office is growing steadily. cable  wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using socalled carrier presection cps services such as talktalk and one.tel which route phone calls across nonbt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4.,2
bees handed potential man utd tie brentford face a home tie against holders manchester united in the fa cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against southampton. the league one side held the saints at st mary's in their fifthround tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against sir alex ferguson's side. newcastle will be at home to either tottenham or nottingham forest. bolton host arsenal or sheffield united and leicester will visit the winners of the burnley and blackburn replay. the ties will be played on the weekend of 1213 march. was delighted to be paired with united although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie. we've got our work cut out next tuesday but you can't deny it's exciting he said. it would be a sellout. it will probably be on television. we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation. we're happy to be in the draw but we've still got to beat a premiership team. we've got to beat southampton first and that's going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration. welcomed the opportunity to face united. we're not counting on anything yet he said. it is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive. but i've been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham. there are no easy ties in the fa cup and i'm sure nobody is counting on one. newcastle v tottenham or nottingham forest southampton or brentford v manchester united bolton v arsenal or sheffield united burnley or blackburn v leicester,1
games win for bluray dvd format the nextgeneration dvd format bluray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers. bluray backed by 100 firms including sony is competing against toshiba and necbacked hddvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the bluray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold highdefinition video and sound. this offers incredible 3dlike quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005. as we move from standard definition video images to highdefinition images we have a much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic's hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of bluray told the bbc news website. so by utilising blue laserbased technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's dvd. a bluray disc will be able to store 50gb of highquality data while toshiba's hddvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all highdefinition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and bluray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s can be resolved over the next year when nextgeneration dvd players start to come out. when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds. but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to bluray in the battle for supremacy. gaming is a 20 billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced opticaldisc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal. bluray offers the capacity performance and highspeed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming. ea a leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of highdefinition games of the future was vital and bluray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for highquality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higherresolution playback. he added the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion. gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate  all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience. fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photoreal capability the current technology is limiting. they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty. currently graphicsintensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. highdefinition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better highresolution games. bluray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba's hddvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros. the real world benefits of hddvd are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hddvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still ongoing. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world and runs from 6 to 9 january.,2
mobile gig aims to rock 3g forget about going to a crowded bar to enjoy a gig by the latest darlings of the music press. now you could also be at a live gig on your mobile via the latest third generation 3g video phones. rock outfit rooster are playing what has been billed as the first ever concert broadcast by phone on tuesday evening from a london venue. the 45minute gig is due to be phone cast by the 3g mobile phone operator 3. 3g technology lets people take watch and send video clips on their phones as well as swap data much faster than with 2g networks like gsm. people with 3g phones in the uk can already download football and music clips on their handsets. some 1000 fans of the londonbased band will have to pay five pounds for a ticket and need a 3g handset. once you have paid you can come and go as much as you like because we expect the customers to be mobile said 3 spokesperson belinda henderson. it's like going to a concert hall except that you are virtually there. the company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones. we are looking on how long people will stay on average on the streams. some people may stay the whole time some may dip in and out said ms henderson. we actually expect people to dip in and out because they are mobile and they will be doing other things. 3 is looking to music as a way of persuading more people to take up the latest video phones. it is already planning regular gigs throughout 2005. and during the intermission of course you would still be able to make a phone call.,2
eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis the uk's public spending watchdog has said. the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling the eu still had no common definition of fraud. it also expressed concern that for the 10th year the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts. the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. the report said member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european antifraud office on a consistent basis. as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources. it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003 worth 38.5m 52m euros up from 831 cases worth 35.7m in 2002. at the same time reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from 10276 cases worth 808m to 8177 cases worth 644m. edward leigh chairman of the commons public accounts committee said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency. any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community he said. departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity and raise overall standards of financial management. a spokesman for the european antifraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao's assessment of fraud reporting. the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state and there is room for improvement spokesman jorg wojahn said. he added that there is generally good cooperation with member states and the antifraud office on specific cases of fraud with the statistics studied by nao providing a good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud.,0
radcliffe enjoys winning comeback paula radcliffe made a triumphant return to competitive running with victory in the new york marathon. the briton running for the first time since dropping out of the olympic marathon and 10000m held off kenyan susan chepkemei in a thrilling finish. the pair were locked together for the last few miles before radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours 23 minutes and 10 seconds. it's a good way to end the year she said. i'm ready for a good rest now. radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. but the world recordholder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace. just chepkemei and radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles. the kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off radcliffe but the briton managed to hang in. both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in central park. but it was radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off chepkemei in the closest finish in the race's history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in athens.,1
europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project. in nice last week the european commission announced its networked  electronic media nem initiative. its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback. the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme. more than 120 experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica. it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible standalone solutions working. a longterm strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach. they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses. the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are. where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them. what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management drm schemes. currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms. with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant drm scheme is huge. although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home. the 10year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years. simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media,2
games enter the classroom video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom. with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab. mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error. futurelab is a nonprofit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpoolbased games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market. learning games were somewhat oldfashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions. the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. the result is racing academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well. it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen. players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing. teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances. this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen. the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive. pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. games in the classroom need to support the teacher. it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said. professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms. use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular. traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used socalled edutainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research. it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning. 'lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles  persuading developers to write for the educational market. this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen. even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said. it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.,2
china 'blocks google news site' china has been accused of blocking access to google news by the media watchdog reporters without borders. the parisbased pressure group said the englishlanguage news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. it said the aim was to force people to use a chinese edition of the site which according to the watchdog does not include critical reports. google told the bbc news website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes. china is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world. a net police force monitors websites and emails and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. popular chinese portals such as sina.com and sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. and all 110000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive. china is censoring google news to force internet users to use the chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports said the group in a statement. by agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government google has let itself be used by beijing it said. for its part the search giant said it was looking into the issue. it appears that many users in china are having difficulty accessing google news sites in china and we are working to understand and resolve the issue said a google spokesperson. google news gathers information from some 4500 news sources. headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm with no human editorial intervention. it offers 15 editions of the service including one tailored for china and one for hong kong. google launched a version in simplified chinese in september. the site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. but google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within china as this would result in broken links.,2
kilroysilk attacked with slurry euro mp robert kilroysilk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in manchester. the uk independence party member was arriving for a bbc radio show when the attacker emerged from behind a bush. fellow guest ruth kelly mp was also hit by the slurry. mr kilroysilk said the man who later disappeared claimed he was doing it in the name of islam. in january mr kilroysilk quit his bbc one show for remarks he made about arabs who he called suicide bombers. mr kilroysilk had already been taken off air by bbc bosses for the comments in which he also described arabs as limbamputators women repressors. the remarks prompted outrage among muslim groups. the slurry attack took place on friday as mr kilroysilk and ms kelly a cabinet office minister and bolton west mp arrived at manchester high school for girls for the recording of bbc radio 4's any questions. the police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. they are treating the incident as assault. the programme's host jonathan dimbleby later told the audience the mep had been covered from head to toe. mr kilroysilk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes. he told reporters he was very angry and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. he said the man shouted you've offended my religion i'm doing this in the name of islam. as i started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car mr kilroysilk said. i was totally covered it was all through my clothes and it stank to high heaven. it went all inside the car and splattered ruth kelly. a bbc spokesman said he took his seat as jonathan dimbleby was introducing the show. fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have. greater manchester police said people near mr kilroysilk had also been hit by the waste. officers took statements at the scene but no arrests have been made. police say the suspect ran off after towards wilmslow road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red vauxhall corsa earlier. the suspect is described as white aged 30 to 40 with a ginger beard. police want to hear from anyone who has any information. mr kilroysilk an mep for the east midlands resigned the uk independence party whip in the european parliament in october after criticising ukip and stating his ambition to be leader. however he remains a member of the party. he said on friday he hoped to be elected party leader before christmas. i think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the general election. but a ukip spokesman said that would be impossible under the party's constitution which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.,0
what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics. it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the 34yearold has repeatedly chosen to tick the don't know box. holmes has now pulled out of this weekend's european indoor championships where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m because of a hamstring injury. but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well it's a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram. you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you're very talented. holmes' drive and determination have always been unquestionable  that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career emptyhanded. but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself. will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year. that is what i don't know. at 34 holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson a fivetime olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain's double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the daytoday grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesn't like the training anymore. whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens the 34yearold revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title. holmes' wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes' motivation  the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn't they be at least shared and celebrated you don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram. you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it's a fantastic feeling. i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain. athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the newlook kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again that's just kelly explains cram. she's always been like that. she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it's headline news. kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line. and if she decides not to run again noone is going to turn round and say 'you're making the wrong decision.',1
london hope over chepkemei london marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete susan chepkemei will still take part in this year's race on 17 april. chepkemei was suspended from all competition until the end of the year by athletics kenya after failing to report to a national training camp. we are watching it closely said london race director david bedford. there is a long way to go before the race and we are hoping the situation will be satisfactorily resolved. the camp in embu was to prepare for the iaaf world cross country championships later this month. chepkemei however took part and finished third in last sunday's world best 10k race in puerto rico. the 29yearold has finished second to paula radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 london races as well as in november's new york city marathon.,1
councils 'must find gypsy sites' ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments. councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper. in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3500 travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out 25m in four years with 8m available for 2005. there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper. firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites. the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers. that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the shortterm because of risk to local amenity and the environment. under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments. andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do. living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no one's idea of fun. in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps. in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. two of the most controversial traveller sites  cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire  remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.,0
commodore finds new lease of life the oncefamous commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a usbased digital music distributor. new owner yeahronimo media ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of commodore computers. it also plans to develop a worldwide entertainment concept with the brand although details are not yet known. the groundbreaking commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s. in the chronology of home computing commodore was one of the pioneers. the commodore 64 launched in 1982 was one of the first affordable home pcs. it was followed a few years later by the amiga. the commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system even to this day. the brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. commodore international filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to dutch firm tulip computers. in the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to atari which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games formerly known as infogrames. tulip computers sold several products under the commodore name including portable usb storage devices and digital music players. it had planned to relaunch the brand following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980sera games. commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for windows pc apple mac and even pdas so that the original commodore games can be still run. the sale of commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over 17m.,2
ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting. this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision. the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003 reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections  the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes. the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light. however the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voter's fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have hisher left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors  the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial  especially among groups perceived to be progovernment. widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep  a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society. the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of nongovernmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink  but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems. in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it. in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink  various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward. however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. the passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections. the country's widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 february. david mikosz works for the ifes an international nonprofit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.,2
labour plans maternity pay rise maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by 1400 as part of new proposals announced by the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. it would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007 ms hewitt told gmtv's sunday programme. other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. the tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as desperate while the liberal democrats said it was misdirected. ms hewitt said we have already doubled the length of maternity pay it was 13 weeks when we were elected we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. we are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next parliament. she said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. we have made a firm commitment. we will definitely extend the maternity pay from the six months where it now is to nine months that's the extra 1400. she said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. the shadow secretary of state for the family theresa may said these plans were announced by gordon brown in his prebudget review in december and tony blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters. she said the conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the general election. liberal democrat spokeswoman for women sandra gidley said while mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the liberal democrats feel this money is being misdirected. she said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time. ms hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers not employers. but david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce warned that many small firms could be crippled by the move. while the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay recruitment costs advertising costs retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be he said. further details of the government's plans will be outlined on monday. new mothers are currently entitled to 90 of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth followed by 102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.,0
concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned. the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines. already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system. but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small. for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os2 has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. but ibm will end support for os2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research. he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. todd thiemann spokesman for antivirus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70 of new cash machines being installed were windows based. already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them. in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce. in august of the same year cash machines of two unnamed banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm. incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network. this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said. banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online. but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year. currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10 of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year. windows cash machines have been around for several years he said. most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle. in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os2 he said but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment. it's pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said. the many different security systems builtin to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said. banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added. a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services apacs which represents the uk's payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal. there's no concern that there's going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said. risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightlyknit community than in the us where viruses have struck.,2
screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam email. lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data. we've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said malte pollmann spokesman for lycos europe. in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said but now we are going to go one step further. we've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers. by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said about one mp3 file. but he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. lycos did not want to use email to fight back said mr pollmann. that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said. the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam email messages and which sell the goods and services on offer. typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam email and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from realtime blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop. to limit the chance of mistakes being made lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of highbandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said mr pollmann. sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85. users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver. while working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on 1 december and before now has only been trialled in sweden. despite the soft launch mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20000 times in the last four days. there's a huge user demand to not only filter spam daybyday but to do something more he said before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.,2
mcconnell in 'drunk' remark row scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk once in a while. jack mcconnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk. the first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell. margaret davidson the independent member for the loch ness west said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time. when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle underage drinking began his response with the quip i'm sure there's no underage drinking in the highlands. he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. he said i hope i'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them. mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes and on the health consequences of binge drinking. the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that he said. far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening. he added by all means get drunk once in a while  but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell. we all know that underage drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician particularly the first minister should encourage young people to get drunk. the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately. but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults not youngsters in mind. he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions  which are for the over18s she said. it was just a recognition that people will get drunk but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.,0
collins banned in landmark case sprinter michelle collins has received an eightyear ban for doping offences after a hearing at the north american court of arbitration for sport cas. america's former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal. the 33yearold was found guilty of using performanceenhancing drugs. the us antidoping agency usada decided to press charges against collins in the summer. the sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the cas has upheld usada's findings. the usada has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that collins took epo the testosteroneepitestosterone cream and thg said a cas statement. collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time. so far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the balco doping scandal. world record holder tim montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the usada. his hearing before the csa has been rescheduled for june next year. drug enforcement chiefs in the us have vowed to crack down on cheats. usada chief executive officer terry madden said the action taken against collins was further proof of that. the cas panel's decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of usada's ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of us athletes that compete drugfree said madden. the usada has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into balco rather than test results. the san franciscobased balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. the trial is expected to open next march.,1
creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin head of the team behind the first macintosh computer has died. mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released. he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. the 1984 release of the mac reflected mr raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use. mr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31 initially to lead the company's publications department. however in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. the result was the 1984 macintosh that did away with the then common textbased interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging. although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh. the gui was developed by xerox parc and used in its star machine. but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer. his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him said andy hertzfeld an early macintosh team member. although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released. in 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with apple's mercurial boss steve jobs. in 1982 mr raskin left apple entirely. the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin's favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. after leaving apple mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. he was also an accomplished musician played three instruments and conducted san francisco's chamber opera society. mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california.,2
mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system mps have said. the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access. currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. an arbitrary 'template' imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position the mps said. they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the nonresident parent in contested cases. this would reassert the rights of nonresident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new 'status quo' arrangement for the children to become established by default they said. although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that nonresident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents. committee chairman alan beith said the fivemonth inquiry had been a complex and emotive one. at the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said. this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.,0
cole refuses to blame van persie ashley cole has refused to blame robin van persie for leaving arsenal with no fullyfit strikers for the fa cup fifth round replay at sheffield united. van persie is suspended alongside dennis bergkamp and jose antonio reyes after being sent off at southampton when arsenal had a numerical advantage. thierry henry is ruled out with an achilles tendon injury but cole said noone is putting the blame on robin. it's just something that happens on the spur of the moment. cole added i've done it before and i hope they didn't blame me for anything. of course he'll learn. i've been sent off a couple of times now and it's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds. freddie ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either arturo lupoli quincy owusuabeyie or jeremie aliadiere. gunners boss arsene wenger said freddie is an option but we need a second striker. i have to decide whether it will be aliadiere quincy or lupoli who will start with him up front. those three will be involved. arsenal are also without winger robert pires who sustained an ankle injury at st mary's. wenger added it doesn't look like anything is fractured but it is a good ankle sprain. it does not look like pires will be ready for two to three weeks.,1
microsoft debuts security tools microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware. the virusfighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated antivirus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the antispyware tool. the antispyware tool is available now and the antivirus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft's windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers often without users' knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with popup adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90 of windows machine have the malicious software on board and on average each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec mcafee trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other antivirus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as adaware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its antivirus technology. in december 2004 it bought new yorkbased antispyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their antivirus and firewall programs.,2
a question of trust and technology a major government department is without email for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened. a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days. it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk's department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week. it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of email and access to the application software they use to calculate people's benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances. senior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. fortunately the backoffice systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly. this is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners. i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans. although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network. this is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved. today's computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile. the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems. it is the network equivalent of godel's theorem  any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically. so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck. what is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press. it is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio 4's today programme throughout friday morning. so why did not the prime minister's official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire's disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment. while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too. and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand. that means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it. it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege. a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently. anything less is a betrayal of public trust. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,2
'super union' merger plan touted two of britain's big trade unions could merge to form a super union of two million members. the move by amicus and the transport and general workers union tgwu would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. amicus has 1.2 million members and the tgwu has 800000. any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. it is understood meetings will be held on wednesday about the proposal. along with the gmb and unison the tgwu and amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56point deal with labour's leadership over equality at work holidays and pensions  the warwick agreement. both unions are remaining tightlipped about the merger rumours but one insider pointed out to the bbc news website that nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on wednesday. amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the tgwu is holding specially scheduled talks.,0
time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. i would say it's 5050 whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarterfinals against brazil. often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole team's worth. the debate will rage on and i'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager. the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results. it's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england's game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember svengoran eriksson's side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played. the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.,1
bekele sets sights on world mark olympic 10000m champion kenenisa bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at february's norwich union grand prix in birmingham. the 22yearold will again be chasing a record held by his compatriot and mentor haile gebrselassie who set the mark at the same meeting in 2003. i am still as hungry to do as much as i can in this sport said bekele. and aiming for the two mile world record in birmingham is the next of those targets. gebrselassie's current record stands at eight minutes 04.69 seconds. and bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the national indoor arena. the ethiopian broke the world indoor 5000m record on his debut at the meeting last year. compatriots mulugeta wondimu abiyote abate and markos geneti the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m will race against bekele on 18 february. the meet has already attracted a crop of olympic talent. britain's 800m and 1500m champion kelly holmes is taking part in the 1000m. swedish heptathlon gold medallist carolina kluft will contest the 60m hurdles. while men's 4x100m relay gold medallists jason gardener and mark lewisfrancis will go headtohead in the 60m.,1
cudicini misses carling cup final chelsea goalkeeper carlo cudicini will miss sunday's carling cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against newcastle. the italian was sent off for bringing down shola ameobi in the final minute of sunday's match. blues boss jose mourinho had promised to pick cudicini for the final instead of firstchoice keeper petr cech. the 31yearold will now serve a onematch suspension commencing with immediate effect. cudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for chelsea but petr cech has established himself as first choice for mourinho since moving to stamford bridge in summer 2004. the 22yearold czech republic international has set a new premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal a mark which is still running. but mourinho has used cudicini regularly in the carling cup and the italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during chelsea's run to the final.,1
guantanamo man 'suing government' a british terror suspect held in guantanamo bay for 33 months plans to sue the government it is reported. martin mubanga claimed in the observer that an mi6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the us camp in cuba following his arrest in zambia. mr mubanga 32 from wembley london said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. the home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not well informed. mr mubanga who has dual british and zambian nationality was one of four britons who were released from the us camp in january. he said he was sent there after being interrogated by a british man who said he was from mi6 shortly after his arrest in zambia in march 2002. mr mubanga said he had been in afghanistan and pakistan to study islam. but he said he was unable to return to the uk because he had lost his british passport and was travelling on his zambian passport instead. mr mubanga said the mi6 agent told him the passport had been found in a cave in afghanistan along with documents listing jewish groups in new york and suggested he had been on an alqaeda reconnaissance mission. mr mubanga said the man and an american female defence official tried to recruit him as an agent but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to guantanamo bay. his lawyer louise christian said 'we are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to guantanamo. and menzies campbell the liberal democrats' foreign affairs spokesman said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved mr mubanga's transfer to guantanamo. but a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of british intelligence or security agencies. and home secretary charles clarke told bbc one's breakfast with frost i'm not organising a specific investigation into it. mr mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. he told the observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last march only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years. he claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box naked except for boxer shorts. and he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. mr mubanga who insists he does not feel bitter said i've lost three years of my life because i was a muslim. he added the authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. they've made me what i am  even if i'm not quite sure yet who that person is. the us government denied the claims saying it condemned and prohibited torture. in a statement it said the department of defense has no doubt that mr mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. he was detained to prevent him from fighting against the us and our allies in the war on terror. but fair trials abroad director stephen jakobi said there were similarities between mr mubanga's account and those of other guantanamo detainees. he said the pattern is the same. the real problem is the concentration camp conditions in guantanamo. is charles clarke really pretending this is all made up mr mubanga and the three other freed british detainees were released without charge by uk police on their return from cuba.,0
falconer rebuts 'charade' claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said. ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear. the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids. tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland. it is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said. on tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203 despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been. lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life. the motive has got to be to end suffering. he denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said. i don't think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an excellent job. former conservative leader iain duncan smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.,0
kinnock to urge reform in lords neil kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the house of lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform. on the bbc's breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as brigands muggers bribers and gangsters. but the outgoing european commissioner said his comments  made some 26 years ago  needed to be put in context. he said advocates for reform needed to be inside the lords to vote for it. it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it. mr kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the british council. history demonstrates that it's immensely useful for the british council to have its chairman in the house of lords and that was a conclusive factor. mr kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the lords. but he added the process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently and consequently i did take all these factors into consideration because it's not a decision to be made glibly. the former labour leader said he would probably take the title of lord kinnock of bedwellty  his first constituency for which he was selected in 1969.,0
galloway plea for hostage release exlabour mp george galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker margaret hassan kidnapped in iraq. mrs hassan 59 who led care international operations in iraq was abducted in baghdad on 19 october. mr galloway was expelled from the labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on iraq. he denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the aljazeera arabic television channel. speaking in london on saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newlyfounded party the respect coalition he said i have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations. but this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions. i am prepared to do anything i can to help save her life. a spokesman later said mr galloway had friends in common with ms hassan who he described as a prominent antiwar activist and that he was willing to do anything  go to iraq or be an intermediary or anything that's necessary. since her abduction several videos of mrs hassan have been broadcast by aljazeera. the latest footage showed mrs hassan asking for british troops to be pulled out of iraq. she also urged care international the aid agency she works for to close its office in baghdad and appealed for iraqi women prisoners to be freed. care has since closed down all its operations in iraq.,0
crisis 'ahead in social sciences' a national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up a committee of mps has said. there was an absolute crisis in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts the commons science and technology committee added. major problems are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age it said. the committee was reporting on the work strategy and spending plans of the economic social research council. the council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. it also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. in its report on the council's work the committee said we are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting in particular the qualitative branches of social sciences. this mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry it said. it is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of economic and social research council's limited resources. if the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this. a national strategic capabilities fund to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response the committee added.,0
beattie return calms attack fears everton striker james beattie has been declared fit for training on tuesday despite suffering an alleged assault last saturday. beattie 27 is not believed to be as seriously hurt as some reports have suggested after being the victim of an unprovoked assault in birmingham. he was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following everton's 31 win over aston villa. he was shaken but not badly injured said everton spokesman ian ross. he added he did speak to the police but will not be pressing charges. he has spoken to manager david moyes about what happened. beattie was suspended for the win at aston villa after his red card against chelsea and he will be available again for the merseyside derby at liverpool on 20 march.,1
robots learn 'robotiquette' rules robots are learning lessons on robotiquette  how to behave socially  so they can mix better with humans. by playing games like passtheparcel a university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. the study's findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in humanrobot interaction. the work is part of the european cogniron robotics project and was on show at london's science museum. we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists said professor kerstin dautenhahn project leader at hertfordshire. our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans. the research also focuses on human perception of robots including how they should look and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. without such studies you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds professor dautenhahn told bbc news online. and i want robots to treat humans as human beings and not like other robots she added. in most situations a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person but also with groups of people. to find out how they would react the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play passtheparcel with children. showing off its skills at the science museum the unnamed robot had to select approach and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. it even used speech to give instructions and play music. however according to researchers it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the robotiquette for human interaction. if you think of a robot as a companion for the human being you can think of 20 years into the future concluded professor dautenhahn. it might take even longer because it is very very hard to develop such a robot. you can hear more on this story on the bbc world service's go digital programme.,2
job cuts 'false economy'  tuc plans to shed 71000 civil service jobs will prove to be a false economy that could hamper public sector reforms according to a tuc report. public and commercial services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 november. the tuc said cuts would deliver less than 6 of the 22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. general secretary brendan barber warned the costs could easily outweigh the benefits. the government's big boost to public spending is now showing results said mr barber. public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy. they may shoot a tory fox but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. the costs could easily outweigh the benefits. next friday's strike action by the pcs is the biggest in the civil service since 1993 hitting jobcentres benefit agencies pensions offices customs and driving tests. the union says it is concerned about pensions sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and jobcentres across the uk would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. the number of civil servants in britain rose to more than 520000 in april. other areas the strike will affect include passports museums and galleries libraries and health and safety inspections.,0
housing plans criticised by mps irreversible environmental damage will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in southeast england mps have warned. sustainable communities were being promoted without a real understanding of what sustainable means the environmental audit committee said. it said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed. deputy prime minister john prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. he said we are working across government especially with our colleagues at defra to create cleaner safer and greener communities while protecting and enhancing the environment. the report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues including water even though supplies in parts of the south east are already too low. regulations designed to ensure energyefficient buildings are too lax and builders routinely flout them anyway it said. financing for improving transport was around onetwentieth of what would be required. the report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially john prescott's department bbc environment correspondent richard black said. chairman of the environmental audit committee peter ainsworth mp said the government's housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joinedup policy is crucial. i accept the need to improve housing supply but as things stand the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser. points raised in the report included  no proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence.  the government should recognise shortcomings of the treasury's barker review which said 140000 new homes a year were needed in britain.  the government should consider a national spatial framework for england such as those already in place in scotland and wales.  the office of the deputy prime minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities.  measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered  including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zeroemissions homes.  the government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities. conservative local government spokeswoman caroline spelman said there is now growing evidence that john prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural england.,0
'no more concessions' on terror charles clarke says he has no desire to offer more concessions on his controversial antiterror plans to get them on to the statute book. mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes  but labour's majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde tory leader in the lords said ministers should expect it to be substantially rewritten. the bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against. on monday mps voted 272219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161strong majority cut to just 14 as a crossparty amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order amounting to house arrest would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill. they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals which are for house arrest. but mr clarke told bbc radio 4's today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords. no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords he said. i have no desire to make further socalled concessions on the bill. mr clarke's proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been clearly very badly drawnup and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to rescue the government and make the law tolerable by amending it in the lords. the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous he told bbc news. mark oaten for the liberal democrats said monday night's vote showed the government had lost the confidence of all sides of the house. he said they need to rethink the bill and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. unless there is a major movement this bill is doomed to fail. bbc news political editor andrew marr said i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it's been unravelling in the house of commons  it may unravel further. the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march when the current powers expire.,0
thanou desperate to make return greek sprinter katerina thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent greek tribunal. thanou 30 was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the olympics but the decision was overturned. the iaaf will decide if we can compete again in greece and abroad thanou told to vima newspaper in her first interview since the athens olympics. if given the green light i will run again  that's the only thing i want. thanou 30 and her compatriot kostas kenteris were provisionally suspended by the iaaf in december for missing three drugs tests. the third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the athens olympics. but an independent tribunal of the greek athletics federation overturned the provisional ban on 18 march. the iaaf  which said it was very surprised by the decision of the greek tribunal  is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the court of arbitration for sport. however dick pound the chairman of the world antidoping authority has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not. and thanou and kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident. thanou said i can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse. i cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time. i always said we needed a pr person. an athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment. i am a champion. i cannot risk everything i've achieved in such a silly way.,1

white admits to balco drugs link banned american sprinter kelli white says she knowingly took steroids given to her by bay area lab cooperative balco president victor conte. conte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion and white said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing. he's the one who told me that it wasn't what he said it was white said in the san francisco chronicle. but she added it was my decision to go to him not anybody else's. white said conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil only to change his story later. white failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. she was subsequently handed a twoyear ban in may this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. at first white claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions. my whole belief about victor is that he was selling a product white said in the la times. whether it be a good product or a bad product he was selling a product. white was introduced to conte through her coach remy korchemy who is also a defendant in the balco case. the 27yearold believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. i have no clue what it's going to take to change that said white. i would say i made a mistake and i would never ever go back. i would never recommend anyone to take that route.,1
tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks. the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone. if you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn. people did not know they were being offered a subscription service. we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added. the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk's phone firms. everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox. it's all about transparency he said. consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it. the consumer has a right to be protected he said. christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn. also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said. we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off. under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn.,2
former ni minister scott dies former northern ireland minister sir nicholas scott has died at a london hospice his family has announced. the former conservative mp for kensington and chelsea died after a long illness diagnosed as alzheimer's. the 71yearold served in northern ireland from 1981 to 1987 during the premiership of margaret thatcher. as a northern ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass ira escape from the maze in 1983. in education he encountered criticism over school closures and the future of the catholic training colleges. he also merged the new university of ulster and the ulster polytechnic to create the university of ulster. sir nicholas was a strong defender of the angloirish agreement and was held in esteem in dublin government and sdlp circles. but he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him minister of discord. after leaving northern ireland in a reshuffle he became a uk disability minister. sir nicholas was replaced as the member for kensington and chelsea by the flamboyant alan clark after being deselected by his constituency in december 1996. his deselection followed a series of scandals including being found slumped in the street by police during the tory party conference in bournemouth and taken back to his hotel. sir nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol. after his sacking he bitterly said that despite the support of cabinet ministers and tory backbenchers the eurosceptics in his constituency were absolutely determined to get rid of me. his colourful career also included a very public disagreement with daughter victoria over civil rights for the disabled. sir nicholas admitted he misled mps when he denied his department had been involved in wrecking tactics designed to kill the disability bill in 1994. victoria a lobbyist for disabled rights denounced her father's actions and heaped insult on injury when she joined the calls for him to resign. he joined the backbenches two months later.,0
edu describes tunnel fracas arsenal's edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester united's win over the gunners. the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson. i saw people being pulled apart people pushing pointing and shouting he told uefa's official website. the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but i didn't see any soup being thrown at anyone. however edu tried to play down the incidents adding there was nothing that i haven't seen in brazilian derbies. derby matches in brazil are worse. i like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry. but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of united's challenges during the game particularly on jose antonio reyes. i think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than united he said. reyes was being kicked all over the park  they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off. following the game the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel. it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee.,1
barcelona title hopes hit by loss barcelona's pursuit of the spanish title took a blow on sunday as they fell to a 20 defeat at home to atletico madrid. fernando torres gave athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute. ronaldino wasted a secondhalf chance to equalise for barca when he put a penalty wide but torres made no such mistake with a lastminute spotkick. the defeat coupled with real madrid's 40 win over espanyol on saturday reduces barca's lead to four points. former everton midfielder thomas gravesen scored his first goal for real in the comfortable victory at the bernabeu. zinedine zidane had opened the scoring before raul bagged a brace. gravesen who replaced zidane completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. david beckham watched by svengoran eriksson came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for england's game against holland. england teammate michael owen came on for raul after 76 minutes with the game already won. real have now won six consecutive primera liga games since coach wanderley luxemburgo took charge.,1
bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official reelection site of president george w bush. the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp. the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney failed. by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. on 21 october the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. mike prettejohn president of netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the runup to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however simply blocking nonus visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites.,2
sociedad set to rescue mladenovic rangers are set to loan outoffavour midfielder dragan mladenovic to real sociedad despite the closure of the january transfer window. sociedad have been given special permission by the spanish fa to sign a player due to an injury crisis. mladenovic will effectively replace former rangers midfielder mikel arteta who has been loaned to everton. sociedad say they will pay rangers 150000 with an option to buy the serbia  montenegro international. mladenovic's loan move is subject to him passing a medical. the 28yearold who joined rangers from red star belgrade for 1.2m in the close season is expected in san sebastian later this week following his national side's game against bulgaria. sociedad are in 15th place in the 20strong primera liga just two points above the relegation zone. special permission from the spanish fa came after an injury to central defender igor jauregi. the versatile mladenovic can also play in the back four. his agent said last month that rangers had told him to find the player a new club. mladenovic's time at ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the glasgow club.,1

halo fans' hope for sequel xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have preordered the sequel. a science fiction epic halo centred the action on a human cyborg controlled by the player who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not  but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven's ringworld and the film starship troopers it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles  it was graphically impressive had tremendous audio using dolby digital a decent storyline instant playability and impressive physics. but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormouslyhigh production values not usually associated with video gaming. produced by bungie software renowned for their innovation in gaming it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera editor of fansite halo.bungie.org said bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be. he added graphically it was superior to everything else out there. it also had a depth to it that made it stand out. halo was unusually immersive sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world  for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time. the game instantly cultivated an online following which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website which attracts 600000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news. when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. halo is the most important launch game for any console ever wrote the influential edge magazine in its review giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a oneoff original as a game it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun said errera remarking on the level of detail in the game. the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo said errera referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game's amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essaylength articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high. it does not feel like a game release any more. somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft's history. we're all just hoping that bungie has got it right again. halo 2 is out on 9 november in the us and 11 november in the uk,2
firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft's internet explorer has a serious rival in the longawaited firefox 1.0 web browser which has just been released. few people get excited when some new software is released especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of prelaunch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's internet explorer browser. firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations but which had the same core technology were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft's internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability. internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year according to websidestory internet explorer was used by about 95 of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7 and by the end of october stood at 92.9. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10 of the windows using netbrowsing population. firefox is proving popular because at the moment it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft's program. for instance firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks popups has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed. one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras or extensions produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different addons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix also has a growing number of vocal netbased fans. a campaign coordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the 50000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10000 people had signed up and now about 250000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a threeweek period in late novemberearly december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie's hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera safari amaya and even netscape.,2
collins calls for chambers return world 100m champion kim collins says suspended sprinter dwain chambers should be allowed to compete in the olympics again. chambers was banned for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid thg and his suspension runs out in november this year. but collins says the british olympic association should reverse the decision to ban him from the olympics for life. it was too harsh collins told radio five live. they should reconsider. chambers has been in america learning american football but has not ruled out a return to the track. collins added he is a great guy and i have never had any problems with him. we are friends. i would like to see dwain come back and compete again. he is a good person. even though he made a mistake he understands what he did and should be given a chance once more.,1
leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu. the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recentlyexpanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey's large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult. some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war iera killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair's official spokesman said the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils. the key issue at this week's council will be that of turkey but they will also discuss a range of other matters.,0
'no redraft' for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be redrafted by the european commission ec despite requests by meps. the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive. the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention. in a letter ec president jos233 manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament josep borrell that the commission did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council of ministers as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004. if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law  instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament's request it would be an insult to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the usbased amazon.com holds a patent for its oneclick shopping service for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.,2
real in talks over gravesen move real madrid are closing in on a 2m deal for everton's thomas gravesen after the dane's agent travelled to spain to hold talks about a move. john sivabaek told bbc sport i'm here to listen to what real have to say. nothing has been agreed but this is a big opportunity for any player. the 28yearold's contract expires in the summer but real want a quick deal. sivabaek added i will be meeting real on wednesday. there is serious interest but it is everton's hands. everton must decide whether to cash in now on the denmark midfield man or risk losing him for nothing in the summer. manager david moyes has defiantly claimed that he expects gravesen to still be at everton when the transfer window closes at the end of january. moyes said i speak to tommy regularly and we know where we are at. there's been no contact. we don't want to lose him. real madrid general manager arrigo sacchi is the driving force behind the move convincing vicepresident emilio butragueno and new coach wanderley luxemburgo that gravesen is the right man for the bernabeu. everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer for real and risk their own ambitions for european football. gravesen has been outstanding as everton have established themselves in the premiership's top four this season.,1
microsoft releases patches microsoft has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs. in its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched. the number of holes considered critical is more than usual. they affect windows programs including internet explorer ie media player and instant messaging. four other important fixes were also released. these were considered to be less critical however. if not updated either automatically or manually pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data. one of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws. stephen toulouse a microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out. often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. a further patch fixes a hole in media player windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. the most important ones are those which are classed as critical. its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker sybari software as part of microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.,2
lords wrong on detainees  straw jack straw has attacked the decision by britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws. the foreign secretary said the right to life was the most important liberty and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. law lords were simply wrong to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed. the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men  dealing a major blow to the government's antiterror policy. but mr straw denied it amounted to a constitutional crisis. he said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary he told bbc radio 4's today programme. the foreign secretary insisted it was for parliament and not judges to decide how best britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. but liberal democrat peer lord carlile the government's independent reviewer of antiterrorism laws said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. he said the law lords' ruling was an embarrassment for the government and major changes were needed to the law. the ruling came on charles clarke's first day as home secretary following david blunkett's resignation. in a statement to mps mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. in the meantime we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in antiterrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. but those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday lord bingham  a senior law lord  said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. in a statement detainee 'a' in woodhill prison said i hope now that the government will act upon this decision scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones. the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. solicitor gareth pierce who represents eight of the detainees claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to madness saying two were being held in broadmoor hospital.,0
brown to outline presidency goals next year will be make or break for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies. the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid  spending 0.7 of national income. he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio 4's today programme we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health of illiteracy of poverty particularly in africa but right through the developing countries. his proposals were effectively a new marshall plan for the world including an international finance facility which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to 100bn a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed he argued. the european union's common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems he said but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies. mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with 30000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed including 100 debt relief multilaterally. that is why next year is a test he said. if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results. the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown's speech on wednesday. cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam's paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. the charity's director barbara stocking said 2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure. the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7 of their incomes on aid. but 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair who has described africa as a scar on the world's conscience has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing guff about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing antiretroviral drug treatment to three million africans by 2005. instead only 500000 people would benefit he said. there's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has added mr duncan.,0
fileswappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. one site behind the success of the bittorrent fileswapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies. in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that filesharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to. now the man behind suprnova.org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new fileswapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa filesharing systems. like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek's involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis. users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream. dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peertopeer networks said exeem was the next evolution in filesharing systems. but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. exeem cannot prevent pollution he said. the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like kazaa he said. there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of filesharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. it's hard to compete with free he said. noone from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the filesharing development.,2

straw attacked on china arms moves to lift the european union's ban on arms exports to china have been condemned by human rights groups and the conservatives. the 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of china's crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square in 1989. uk foreign secretary jack straw who will hold talks in beijing on thursday said an eu arms code was more effective than the current ban. but human rights watch says the eu is putting commerce above abuse concerns. in december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. germany and france have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious but mr straw last week said he also wanted it to end despite us objections. he expects it to be lifted over the next six months a prediction which has alarmed critics. brad adams from human rights watch said this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square. there are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for. mr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma. the scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it he told bbc radio 4's world at one. in the uk more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo he said. and only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. the code of conduct is much more effective it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a precondition of lifting the embargo with china he said. mr straw denied the decision would suggest to china that tiananmen square had been forgotten. the level of human rights was a key criteria under the eu arms exports code he said. human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding  but mr straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many eu countries. conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the move would be profoundly wrong. the decision could undermine nato as it severely damaged relations with the us which is opposed to ending the ban. mr ancram argued what the british government is doing is giving in to french and german pressure especially the french who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... it gives the wrong signals to china who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at tiananmen square was wrong. mr straw's china trip is part of regular highlevel meetings with beijing ministers. he will meet chinese counterpart minister li zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries hong kong and china's part in the talks on north korea.,0
chelsea clinch cup in extratime after extratime  score at 90 mins 11 john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79thminute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez's header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too after mourinho's sending off apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. riise could not have connected any better with morientes' cross as he smashed a leftfoot volley past petr cech. the goal the quickestever in a league cup final stunned a blues side whose previously rocksolid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues' attacking chances were limited and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard's powerfullystruck drive and drogba's low shot. despite their frustration chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool's wellorganised defence. joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore but the reds reached halftime without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes first at full stretch from gudjohnsen's header then to smother william gallas' followup. and despite chelsea's possession it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a lastditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later  in the most unfortunate fashion  as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira's freekick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman's feet while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extratime but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the halftime interval drogba made no mistake picking the ball up from glen johnson's long throw inside the sixyard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level but despite liverpool's desperate attacks chelsea clung on to win. dudek finnan carragher hyypia traore biscan 67 luis garcia gerrard hamann riise kewell nunez 56 morientes baros 74. subs not used pellegrino carson. hyypia traore hamann carragher. riise 1 nunez 113. cech paulo ferreira ricardo carvalho terry gallas kezman 74 jarosik gudjohnsen 45 lampard makelele cole johnson 81 drogba duff. subs not used pidgeley tiago. lampard kezman drogba duff. gerrard 79 og drogba 107 kezman 112. 78000 s bennett kent.,1
johnson accuses british sprinters former olympic champion michael johnson has accused britain's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition. at the moment the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain the world 200m and 400m record holder told five live. athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride. however linford christie countered it's easy to criticise when you haven't gone through the system here. johnson was involved in a verbal spat with britain's darren campbell earlier this year. the american had cast doubt on campbell's claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic 100m and 200m finals. and the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting. the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other he claimed. athletes here have to compete more outside the uk. their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter. speaking at an elite coaches' conference in birmingham johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. you can't fix everything with money he admitted. you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding. those who aren't funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging. so when they get to the top they are more appreciative.,1
merritt close to indoor 400m mark teenager lashawn merritt ran the third fastest indoor 400m of all time at the fayetteville invitational meeting. the world junior champion clocked 44.93 seconds to finish well clear of fellow american bershawn jackson in arkansas. only michael johnson has gone quicker setting the world record of 44.63secs in 1995 and running 44.66secs in 1996. kenyan bernard lagat missed out on the world record by 1.45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat canada's nate brannen by almost 10secs. the olympic silver medallist's time of three minutes 49.89secs was inferior only to the 1997 world record of moroccan hicham el guerrouj and former world record holder eamonn coghlan of ireland's 349.78. lagat was on course to break el guerrouj's record through 1200m but could not maintain the pace over the final 400m. ireland's continued his excellent form by winning a tight 3000m in 740.53. cragg who recently defeated olympic 10000m champion kenenisa bekele in boston held off bekele's ethiopian colleague markos geneti by only 0.19secs to secure his victory. mark carroll who will join cragg in the european indoor championships next month finished a solid third in 746.78. olympic 200m gold medallist of jamaica ran the fastest women's 60m in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of 7.09secs. world indoor 60m hurdles champion also won improving his seasonleading time to 7.51secs.,1
iran jails blogger for 14 years an iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counterrevolutionaries. arash sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. mr sigarchi who also edits a newspaper in northern iran was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the gilan area. his sentence criticised by human rights watchdog reporters without borders comes a day after an online day of action to secure his release. iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs restricting access to major blogging sites from within iran. a second iranian blogger motjaba saminejad who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests is still being held. a spokesman for reporters without borders which tracks press freedom across the globe described mr sigarchi's sentence as harsh and called on iranian president mohammed khatami to work to secure his immediate release. the authorities are trying to make an example of him the organisation said in a statement. by handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger their aim is to dissuade journalists and internetusers from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media. in the days before his arrest mr sigarchi gave interviews to the bbc persian service and the usfunded radio farda. iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. they accused mr sigarchi of a string of crimes against iranian state including espionage insulting the founder of iran's islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomenei and current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei. mr sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court illegal and incompetent and called for a retrial in a public court. mr sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world. the committee to protect bloggers designated 22 february 2005 as free mojtaba and arash day. around 10000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. about 12 of users were based in iran the campaign's director told the bbc news website. curt hopkins said mr sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. the eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on iran since sigarchi's sentence not less. the mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.,2
campaign 'cold calls' questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls. the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing  for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a grey area if personal data is kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications. the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. but that did not happen for voter identification calls. when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said. so it is not covered by the telephone preference service. he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again. a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers. she said we do apply tps but in line with the law. we would not do things that are not allowed in the law. a spokesman for the information commissioner's office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics not person by person. if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing he said. the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. the spokesman said there was no yes or no answer and the area was pretty grey. he added if someone complained then we would investigate that. political parties are aware of the regulations. at the last byelections we reminded them. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal. he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls. i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner. mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.,0
gadgets galore on show at fair the 2005 consumer electronics show in las vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the fourday event. top gadgets at the show are highlighted in the innovations showcase which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. the bbc news website took an early preshow look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. one of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images audio and video files. the 2.5gb and 5gb circular pocket hard drive from seagate might help. the external usb drive won a ces best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. it is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their pcs to look cool said seagate. it is all about style but it also has lots of functionality. it is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy it said. in the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. universal electronics' nevosl is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content such as photos no matter where it is in their house. it can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. working with home broadband networks and pcs the gadget has builtin wireless and a colourful simple interface. paul arling uei chief said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. he said the nevo gave people a simple single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. the nevo won two awards at ces one as a girl's best friend award and another for innovation design and engineering. the gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about 799 425. hotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its solo chassis gaming chair. the speciallydesigned chair lets gamers play in surroundsound while stretching out in their own space. it is compatible with all the major games consoles dvd players and pcs. we found that kids love playing in surround sound said jay leboff from hotseat. we are looking at offering different types of seats depending on the market success of this one. the chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. and a drinks holder. the chair which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame should go on sale in april and is expected to cost 399 211. satellite radio is big business in the us. in the uk the digital radio technology is known as dab and works on slightly different technology. eton corporation's porsche designed p7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a dab radio in the uk as well as a satellite radio set in the us. dab sets have been slow to takeoff in the uk but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. it is for the risqu233 consumer said an eton spokesperson. we are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the designconscious consumer. the porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of january in the us and in the first quarter of 2005 in the uk. in the us is it expected to cost 250 133. the average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the consumer electronics association the organisation behind ces. this is expected to grow to a massive 3420 images  or 7.2gb  in five years' time. one gadget that might help swell that collection is sanyo's tiny handheld vpcc4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. it combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. it takes mpeg4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. images and video are stored on sd cards which have come down in price in recent months. a 512mb card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. the device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. because images and video are stored on sd memory it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. mpio's tiny digital usb music players come in an array of fashionable colours taking a leaf out of the apple ipod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. slung on a cord the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. although the pendant design was launched three months ago the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashionconscious gadget fiends. an even dinkier model the fy500 comes out in may and will store about 256mb of music. the range of players recently won an international forum design award 2005.,2
clyde 05 celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semifinal but only after a nervy and testing first half. the home side's craig bryson had a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead. alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled. stilian petrov slid in a third varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on saving from bellamy chris sutton and juninho. clyde had the ball in the net after halfanhour through a tremendous strike from bryson but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov. from the resulting free kick darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him. back at the other end halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net. maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a twogoal lead just after the break. the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty. sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flareup that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it 30 on the hour mark  a quick onetwo giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from 12 yards. varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage  thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net. halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a mcgeady shot wide as the game petered out. halliwell mensing bollan balmer potter sheridan burns 61 arbuckle gilhaney 61 gibson bryson jones 78 malone harty. morrison wilson. mensing sheridan. douglas henchoz mcnamara balde varga juninho paulista thompson lennon lambert 70 sutton maloney 45 petrov mcgeady 70 bellamy. marshall laursen. thompson bellamy.  varga 40 thompson 48 pen petrov 60 varga 68 bellamy 72. 8200 c thomson,1
ibm puts cash behind linux push ibm is spending 100m 52m over the next three years beefing up its commitment to linux software. the cash injection will be used to help its customers use linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. ibm said the money will fund a variety of technical research and marketing initiatives to boost linux use. ibm said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software. in 2004 ibm said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using linux to help staff work together more closely. the money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add linuxbased elements to ibm's workplace software. workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. one of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use linuxbased desktop computers and mobile devices with workplace. even before ibm announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. in 2001 it put 300m into a threeyear linux program and has produced linux versions of many of its programs. linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. they reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation.,2
mido makes third apology ahmed 'mido' hossam has made another apology to the egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team. the 21yearold told a news conference in cairo on sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the pharaohs since july last year. mido said there isn't much i have to say today all there is to say is that i came specially from england to egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes. mido was axed by former coach marco tardelli after failing to answer a national callup claiming he had a groin injury. but he then played in a friendly for his club as roma within 24 hours of a world cup qualifying match at home to cameroon last september. mido added it's not my right to give orders and say when i want to play ... at the same time i will always make sure that i put the national's team's matches as my top priority. i feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as i saw them play against belgium egypt won 40 on wednesday and i simply want to add to their success. i do confess that i was rude to the egyptian press at times but now i have gained more experience and know that i will never go anywhere without the press's support. many of the international stars like david beckham and zinedine zidane had the press opposing them. so i'm now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and i don't have to overreact when this happens. meanwhile egypt fa spokesman methat shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on mido to apologise. mido's apology today does not negatively affect mido in anyway on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players shalaby said. shalaby earlier said that after an apology mido would be available for the national side if coach hassan shehata chose him. mido joined tottenham in an 18month loan deal near the end of the january transfer window scoring twice on his debut against portsmouth.,1
talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend. five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour's spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations  due to be introduced in weeks  which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days britain's biggest union unison will start balloting 800000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the less painful option our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union pcs will coordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. for a government that lectures everyone on choice  choice on public service choice on this and choice on that  isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said. if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years  that is working until people drop. in the 20th century it's completely unacceptable. unison's 800000 workers the transport and general workers' union's 70000 and amicus' 20000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.,0
first look at playstation 3 chip some details of the chip inside sony's playstation 3 have been revealed. sony ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the socalled cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. the three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. in a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. when put inside powerful computer servers the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations or calculations every second. the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. as well as being inside the playstation 3 the chip will also be used inside highdefinition tvs and powerful computers. in the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network said ken kutaragi chief operating officer of sony. current pc architecture is nearing its limits.,2
a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago. back in 1994 yahoo had only just launched most websites were textbased and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear. but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today. roughly 80 of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today he said. some have gone away because users have changed and 10 have changed because technology has changed. some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen. but there's great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website. dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design were as important as ever. it's necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said. they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would. a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said. but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband. dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net. all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said. they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said. but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use 2.2 terms. in 1994 only 1.3 words were used. i think it's amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10year period of those search terms said dr nielsen. you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital,2
blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation. the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith's statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a fair summary of lord goldsmith's opinion. that's what he lord goldsmith said and that's what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue saying it had been dealt with literally scores of times and the position has not changed. lord goldsmith has denied being leaned on and says the words written were his. the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war  saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into prewar intelligence told the bbc on friday that as a general rule is right but it's not an absolute rule. he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charles's marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said. mr mates added we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers' advice to the government has been published. and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. this is argument was rejected by mr blair who said firstly we haven't broken the precedent and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it. in a book published this week philippe sands qc a member of cherie blair's matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. but a short statement about lord goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003  just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands' book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code. my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee summon the attorney get all the papers out look at exactly what happened she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday lord goldsmith said his statement had not been written by or at number 10. in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003 i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions he said.,0
hearts 21 livingston hearts wrapped up their scottish cup quarterfinal tie against livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes. lee miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds heading over colin meldrum and into the net from a jamie mcallister free kick. mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. craig easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on. the opening goal came after gus bahoken had clumsily fouled miller 35 yards from goal. mcallister floated the free kick into the livi box and miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over meldrum. with just 10 minutes on the clock the home side doubled their lead. mikoliunas sprinted down the right crossed to the back post where mcallister raced in to head past meldrum. moments later miller came close to grabbing his second with a firsttime drive from 16 yards which skimmed the bar. then mcallister picked up a pass from stephen simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past meldrum's far post. the impressive mikoliunas twice went close before half time  a low drive was comfortably gathered by meldrum and then he curled a leftfooted shot past the keeper's righthand post. livi manager richard gough made three changes at the interval bringing on defender goran stanic midfielder gabor vincze and striker ferenc horvath for bahoken derek lilley and mark wilson. but in the opening stages of the second period little changed. however the west lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. eric deloumeaux sent jason dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to mcpake who looked to be in an offside position. the livi striker ignored the pass however and dair ran on to it and played easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. the home side called for offside against mcpake but referee alan freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centrecircle. livi went all out for the equaliser. in the 87th minute burton o'brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by neil macfarlane but dair sent his shot just inches wide. gordon webster miller hartley neilson mcallister simmons macfarlane 64 berra burchill wyness 82 mikoliunas cesnauskis 77 wallace. moilanen kizys. berra webster. miller 1 mcallister 10. meldrum mcnamee bahoken stanic 45 deloumeaux strong dair easton mark wilson vincze 45 lilley horvath 45 o'brien mcpake. mckenzie hand.  vincze horvath. easton 60. 9796 a freeland,1
uk set to cut back on embassies nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced. the bahamas east timor madagascar and swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shakeup for the diplomatic service for years. other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. mr straw said the move would save 6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism. honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed mostly in europe and america. they include dallas in the us bordeaux in france and oporto in portugal with local staff replacing uk representation in another 11. the changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006 with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. in a written statement mr straw said the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth office's strategic priorities including counter proliferation counterterrorism energy and climate change. some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. in africa for instance we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane. the foreign office currently has about 6100 ukbased staff. it has opened major new missions on baghdad and basra in iraq kabul in afghanistan and pyongyang in north korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed  excluding wednesday's cuts  but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. the shakeup is aimed at helping making 86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. the chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected he said.,0
loyalty cards idea for tv addicts viewers could soon be rewarded for watching tv as loyalty cards come to a screen near you. any household hooked up to sky could soon be using smartcards in conjunction with their settop boxes. broadcasters such as sky and itv could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme. sky will activate a spare slot on settop boxes in january marketing magazine new media age reported. sky settop boxes have two slots. one is for the viewer's decryption card while the other has been dormant until now. loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets as high street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multichannel tv. viewers who stay loyal to a particular tv channel could be rewarded by free tv content or freebies from retail partners. broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs. parents could prepay for some content as a kind of tv pocket money card said nigel whalley managing director of media consultancy decipher. viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market said mr whalley. credit cards that have been chipped could be used in settop boxes to pay for movies gambling and gaming. the idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. it will be down to the ingenuity of the content players said mr whalley. for the bbc revenuegenerating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to freeview settop boxes said mr whalley. currently most freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard. some 7.4 million households have sky boxes and sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010. loyalty cards could play a role in this particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their sky subscriptions said ian fogg an analyst with jupiter research.,2
bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was not good enough for the magpies. bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness. souness  who refused to refer to the 25yearold by name  said bellamy did not score enough goals the chap that's just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football  half of those weren't even in the top flight said souness. that's not good enough for a striker at a club like this. we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis. bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying. there are certain things you can forgive and forget said souness. but if i'd been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle. he could then return to st james' park  and he says that he wants to. however it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge.,1
report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects. a national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by 1.7bn in the past year. it says there is little evidence the mod's performance had improved despite the introduction of a smart acquisition policy six years ago. a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned. the nao's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach 50bn  14 higher than originally planned. the total delays amounted to 62 months with average individual delays rising by three months. sir john bourn head of the nao said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase the report says. the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older legacy projects such as the eurofighter. a senior defence official speaking to the bbc's defence correspondent paul adams said that although the figures were still not good enough the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. this year's overspend was significantly less than last year's 3.1bn total and the defence procurement agency  which is responsible for buying defence equipment  was improving. lord bach minister for defence procurement said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects. the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months and according to our correspondent contain few new surprises. turning around the defence procurement agency was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker  it takes a very long time indeed he said. our correspondent said it was the same projects including the joint strike fighter the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost overruns and delay. but he added some projects such as the c17 heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe siff were showing good performances.,0
chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry telling supporters the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election. the chancellor said the vote  expected to fall on 5 may  will give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and conservative cuts. speaking at labour's spring conference in gateshead mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands. he said tory plans to cut 35bn tax would cut deep into public service. to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country he told activists. laying into the conservative's record in government he said i give you this promise  with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10 inflation 15 interest rates 3bn in lost reserves 250000 repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. never again tory boom and bust. this will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of 35bn in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by 2008 60bn more. turning to the economy the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power. he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to the only party trusted with the economy. it was now a party not just of employees but of employers and managers he said. in the speech  which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly warm to mr brown  he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100 debt relief for the world's poorest countries a national minimum wage for 16 and 17yearolds and the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session fielding queries sent in by email text message and telephone as part of labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign.,0
warnings about junk mail deluge the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase say experts. antispam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real email messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent. before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous email relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. steve linford director of spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net's email sending infrastructure. david stanley uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers. they are adding to their armoury he said. the amount of spam in circulation was still growing said mr stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean email meltdown. but kevin hogan senior manager at symantec security response said such warnings were premature. if something like this mean the end of email then email would have stopped twothree years ago said mr hogan. while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. mr hogan said 90 of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. for instance said mr hogan filtering out email messages that contain a web link can stop about 75 of spam.,2
jol joy at 'professional' cup win tottenham manager martin jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 30 fa cup fifthround victory over a determined nottingham forest side. we had the initiative but it wasn't easy. it was a professional sort of performance the dutchman said. forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half but at 20 they were dead and buried. looking ahead to the quarterfinal jol said newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult. however he added that his side who are four places above the magpies in the premiership were not afraid of anyone. robbie keane skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal echoed his manager's sentiments on the lasteight match. they're on a high but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win he said. he conceded the win over forest which included goals from noe pamarot and mido was not pretty to watch. it wasn't the best display but it's all about the result the irishman said. we knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions. the pitch wasn't the best but we still tried to pass it. we dug in and the gaffer said to us at halftime to keep being patient and that the goal will come. forest manager gary megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance. if you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team he said. if we defend in the championship like we did we'll not get another point. we were organised but i felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn't look like scoring.,1
crucial decision on supercasinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on supercasinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament. the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk one of which is likely to be in glasgow. scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a supercasino will be built in scotland. but opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. the vote is due to be taken on wednesday and is expected to be close. the scottish executive believes that the legislation should be handled by westminster. the new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. a supercasino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre. the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of supercasinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.,0
wifi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres linked by wireless technology is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru. the pilot scheme in the huaral valley 80 kilometres north of the capital lima aims to offer the 6000strong community uptodate information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancayhuaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than 13000 rural inhabitants as well as 18000 students in the region will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure. the 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september. the nongovernment organisation cepes peruvian centre for social studies led the 200000 project also backed by local institutions the education and agriculture ministries and european development organisations. the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system said carlos saldarriaga technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network selfsustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes. one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system with its flagship huaral.org website. there farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancayhuaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru's coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world. cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. throughout the last three years the people have provided a vital thrust to the project they feel it belongs to them said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions attended by an equal number of men and women have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. we have had an excellent response mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50year old women who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives. so far the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in peru. this is a pilot project and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places underlined mr saldarriaga. the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo a 50family community with no electricity during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a minihydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers the communications equipment and the cabin lights. it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs recalls carlos saldarriaga. the logical answer was 'we don't sell any' so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing. now with the wireless network cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.,2

net regulation 'still possible' the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said. content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tvquality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options. lord currie chairman of superregulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate organised by the internet service providers' association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation. the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or selfregulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion. some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005 and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net. more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc. head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said. in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in 2002. this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several highprofile legal cases. richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. huge changes are afoot in 2005 he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net. the bbc's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said. one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers. as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it. mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online. in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. if content is ondemand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. there is no watershed on the net said mr burke.,2
xbox power cable 'fire fear' microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its xbox consoles due to safety concerns. the company said the move was a preventative step after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. it affects xboxes made before 23 october 2003 for all regions but mainland europe  and consoles in that region made before 13 january 2004. microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. the firm said fewer than one in 10000 consoles had experienced component failures. the recall affects almost three quarters of all xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001. in a statement it added in almost all instances any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console. but in seven cases customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. in 23 cases customers reported smoke damage or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. this is a preventative step we're choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents said robbie bach senior vice president microsoft home and entertainment division. we regret the inconvenience but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do. consumers can order a new cable from the xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the uk. microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. it advised users to turn off their xboxes when not in use. a followup to xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006.,2
blair congratulates bush on win tony blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with george bush and working with him during his second term as president. mr bush's reelection came at a crucial time for a world that was fractured divided and uncertain mr blair said. it had to be brought together he added saying action was needed on poverty the middle east and the conditions on which terrorists prey. mr blair said states had to work with the us to fight global terrorism. but there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values he added. solving the conflict in the middle east was the world's single most pressing political challenge of the present day mr blair warned. the prime minister also urged europe and the us to build anew their alliance. all of us in positions of leadership not just president bush have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. it is urgent that we do so. mr blair also paid tribute to democrat john kerry's campaign saying he had helped make the presidential election a true celebration of american democracy. the election of the us president was significant for the world but particularly so for britain because of its special relationship he added. earlier tory leader michael howard sent mr bush his warmest congratulations saying we look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election unlike in 2000. mr bush's first task was to rebuild a sense of domestic purpose within the us he said. mr kennedy said internationally it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with longstanding allies not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said a win by mr kerry would have given mr blair the chance of a fresh start adding it was almost as if there was an umbilical cord between mr bush and the uk premier. europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come. even before the result became clear mr blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won. liberal democrat environment spokesman norman baker underlined the issue of global warming during a commons debate on angloamerican relations on wednesday. environment secretary margaret beckett has said the us will act on global warming despite george bush's refusal to sign up to the kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. public opinion would force change she told bbc news. but myron ebell an adviser on climate change to president bush has said there would be no change in the us stance and rejected the threat of climate change. he claimed the us was the only country with independent scientists.,0
tsunami 'won't divert africa aid' uk aid to help the victims of the asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from africa prime minister tony blair has promised. mr blair told the bbc's breakfast with frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not invade the money britain wanted to spend on africa. questioned about the disaster he said his faith in god had not been shaken. he added he would give new figures on the number of tsunamirelated british deaths to the commons on monday. foreign secretary jack straw said on friday that about 440 britons were either dead or missing in the disaster. mr blair told sunday's programme since jack straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they haven't moved a great deal which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers. but we just can't be sure. it is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures all countries are struggling with this. he said the 50 million originally allocated from the department for international development was now well on the way to being spent. but the exact allocation could not be clarified until the world bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected. within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the longterm costs of reconstruction he added. but he pledged that africa  which sees a preventable tsunamisize death toll every month from conflict disease and poverty  would not be neglected. as britain takes up its presidency of the g8 group of leading nations mr blair said ministers had a big agenda for africa. for the first time we have a plan that won't just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within african countries and conflict resolution he said. a lot of the problems in africa come from conflict that again are preventable but only with the right systems in place.,0
technology gets the creative bug the hitech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required. often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. but that dance is growing more intimate as hitech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. and vice versa. uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative. the idea says bt is to shape a 21st century model which will help cement the art technology and business worlds together. we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology said frank stone head of the bt's business sector programmes. he looks after several centres of excellence which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries. to mark the initiative's launch a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer. they have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. using a 3d graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming baftawinning artists langlands  bell have created a virtual storybased 3d model of brussels' coudenberg cellars. they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace an historical seat of european power. the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century. the river was integral to the city's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared said the artists. we hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the river senne. in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine. the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering game ai and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. they are so timeconsuming and expensive to create the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphicsintensive games. bt's own engine tara total abstract rendering architecture has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. it was also used in 2003 in encounter an urbanbased pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical onthestreet action. because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets. but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself. as more tools for selfexpression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology. the orange expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation. technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. the art world is fantastically rich said mr stone with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them. between 1997 and 2002 the creative industry brought 21 billion to london alone. it is an industry that is growing by 6 a year too. the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net according to mr stone. this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online he said. it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem. with broadband penetration reaching 100 in the uk businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries or more patent ideas for tech companies. what we are trying to do is have outsidein thinking. we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy said mr stone.,2
voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs  online spaces where people publish their thoughts  of the year. nominations were announced on sunday but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories from the top regional blog to the bestkeptsecret blog. blogs had a huge year with a top us dictionary naming blog word of 2004. technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12000 are added daily. a blog is created every 5.8 seconds according to us research thinktank pew internet and american life but less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months. nikolai nolan who has run the bloggies for the past five years told the bbc news website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. the awards always get a lot of traffic this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit so i had to guess how much i'd need he said. there were many new finalists this year he added and a few that had won bloggies before. several entries reflected specific news events. there are four nominations for the southeast asia earthquake and tsunami blog which is a pretty timely one for 2005 said mr nolan. the big bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. the nominated blogs are wideranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. fighting it out for the coveted award are gawker this fish needs a bicycle wonkette boing boing and gothamist. in a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs the southeast asia earthquake and tsunami blog is also nominated in the best overall category. greenfairydotcom londonist hicksdesign plasticbag and london underground tube blog are the nominees in the best british or irish weblog. included in the other categories is best meme. this is for the top replicating idea that spread about weblogs. nominations include flickr a web photo album which lets people upload tag share and publish their images to blogs. podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. it is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of rss really simple syndication and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows and distribute them automatically onto portable devices. many are done by those who already have textbased blogs so they are almost like audio blogs. three new categories have been added to the list this year including best food best entertainment and best writing of a weblog. one of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. the winners of the fifth annual bloggies are chosen by the public. public voting closes on 3 february and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 march.,2
gadget show heralds mp3 season partners of those who love their hitech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this christmas. with apple's ipod topping wish lists again there may not be enough ipod minis to go round predicts oliver irish editor of gadget magazine stuff. the ipod mini is likely to be this year's tracey island said mr irish. stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the ipod is at number one. for anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market stuff and what hifi are hosting a bestof gadget show in london this weekend. star of the show will be sony's qrio robot an allsinging alldancing footballplaying manmachine who can even hold intelligent conversations. but he is not for sale and sony has no commercial plans for the robot. he will greet visitors and is flying in from japan. he probably has his own airplane seat that is how highly sony prize him said mr irish. also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. the event will play host to a large collection of digital music players from companies such as creative sony and philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable ipod from apple. suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless christmas are unlikely to come true as mp3 players remain the most popular stocking filler said mr irish. demand is huge and apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on ipod minis said mr irish. for those who like their gadgets to be multitalented the gizmondo a powerful gaming console with gps and gprs that also doubles up as an mp3 player movie player and camera could be a musthave. what is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them said mr irish. this christmas gadgets will not be an allmale preserve. women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves said mr irish. gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks.,2
women mps reveal sexist taunts women mps endure shocking levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts a new study shows. male mps pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered melons as women made commons speeches researchers from birkbeck college were told. labour's yvette cooper said she found it hard to persuade commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. some 83 mps gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study whose secretary are you minister. the research team under professor joni lovenduski had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at westminster. but what emerged was complaints from mps of all parties of sexist barracking in the chamber sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. barbara follet one of the socalled blair babes elected in 1997 told researchers i remember some conservatives  whenever a labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts  imaginary breasts  in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke. former liberal democrat mp jackie ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading mp on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. and extory education secretary gillian shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women betty. when i said 'look you know my name isn't betty' he said 'ah but you're all the same so i call you all betty'. harriet harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the cabinet well you've only succeeded because you're a woman. another current member of the cabinet says she was told oh you've had a very fast rise who have you been sleeping with even after the great influx of women mps at the 1997 general election and greater numbers of women in the cabinet female mps often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world. liberal democrat sarah teather the most recent female mp to be elected told researchers lots of people say it's like an old boys club. i've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school  you know a public school full of teenagers. prof joni lovenduski who conducted the study with the help of margaret moran mp and a team of journalists said she was shocked at the findings. we expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. we expected to find a couple of shocking episodes. but she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. this was mainly because there were more women present in parliament who were not prepared to put up with the sexist attitudes they came across prof lovenduski said. but she added some women including the women who came in 1997 received extraordinary treatment and i am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. what i think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the house of commons. the interviews are to be placed in the british library as a historical record.,0
protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the high court. baa's expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the 2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion heathrow antinoise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport or when it changed takeoff and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport white paper could be left in ruins. the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield leader of essex county council told bbc radio 4's today programme we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper. then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go. he added politicians should not decide where runways should be. the stansted expansion apart from the building of the new runway would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year. the airport is the hub of many of the nofrills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow gatwick edinburgh and glasgow airports baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004 which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noisehit properties for an indexlinked unblighted price. at heathrow baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.,0
moyes uturn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas. the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 10 saying gallas overreacted. but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. he said i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct. moyes added my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick rerun of the incident. the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturday's match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised. moyes continued although the incident was totally out of character  james has never even been suspended before in his career  his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his teammates. james did issue a formal apology to myself his teammates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened. however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily. speaking immediately after the game moyes said i don't think it was a sendingoff i have been a centrehalf in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that. not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way. i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. what has happened to big strong centrehalves i thought it was a push initially and i still don't think it was a sendingoff. an angry beattie initially said he gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him. i can tell you it wasn't an intentional headbutt. we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself 'if you're going to stay in my way i'll go straight over you'. our heads barely touched and it wasn't an intentional headbutt.,1
police probe bnp mosque leaflet police are investigating a british national party leaflet posted to homes in south wales opposing plans for a new mosque. antiracism campaigners in swansea have handed copies to south wales police. swansea's muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former st andrews united reform church. the building on george street has been derelict since the 1980s. taha idris director of the swansea bay race equality council said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public. i'm quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the bnp in swansea he said. the bnp has tried in the past to get into swansea and this is another example of them trying again. i am in no doubt that the bnp are not needed and not wanted here. a south wales police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. according to the bnp's website they have been posted to homes in the castle ward. the bnp website carries a photograph of party leader nick griffin  who lives near welshpool mid wales  delivering the leaflet. the bnp has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. swansea unite against fascism uaf is meeting this week to plan a campaign. following the death earlier this year of kalan kawa karim an iraqi kurd living in swansea it organised an antiracism march in the city that was supported by more than 1000 people. it is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque. andy richards of swansea uaf said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the bnp. the people of swansea will not put up with this. swansea's muslim community bought the former church just across the road from the existing mosque on st helen's road in the late 1990s. mr idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building. it is a landmark building in swansea and would otherwise just crumble he said. it is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner. it will be a muslim community centre. it's a holistic place used for education weddings deaths and births. he said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions muslims had to travel to llanelli for cultural events.,0
reyes tricked into real admission jose antonio reyes has added to speculation linking him with a move from arsenal to real madrid after falling victim to a radio prank. the spaniard believed he was talking to real madrid sporting director emilio butragueno when he allegedly berated his teammates as bad people. i wish i was playing for real madrid the 21yearold told cadena cope. hopefully it could happen. i love the way madrid play. i'm not happy with the way things are. the striker joined the gunners from seville for 17m at the start of 2004 but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick. he began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as arsenal have gradually lost the premiership initiative to manchester united and chelsea. if i'm not playing for real i'm going to have to carry on playing with some bad people he added. i'm sure there are none in the real dressing room. i'm happy madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since i was little to play there. before the story surfaced reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the spanish giants issuing a statement through arsenal describing the speculation as flattering. i have seen the stories in the media linking me with real madrid he had said on thursday lunchtime. but not only am i under contract at arsenal i am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies. butragueno meanwhile was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey. it is a disgrace there is no foundation to this he said. he is an arsenal player and we have to be respectful. we have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news.,1

home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. according to the study more than 45 million people in the uk germany us and south korea now only use a mobile. it showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. the nokiasponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter between mobiles and to friends. in the uk 69 of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. however when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. in the us and germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. in all the countries where interviews were carried out older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone the research found. the move to mobile was most pronounced in south korea where 65 of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18 said they would not get a landline if they moved house. many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the cosiness of making a call there. nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap reliable and providing good call quality. the survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. polling firm mori interviewed more than 6000 people in the uk us germany and south korea for the survey.,2
ministers deny care sums 'wrong' ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was underestimated. a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure. the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the care development group of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university's fraser of allander institute. dubious assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another 130m by 2022 the report warned. it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland we don't think we got our sums wrong. obviously we will examine the findings of this new report along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned. we will look in great detail at any contribution to this because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future. and we are absolutely committed to doing that. but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive's support for the policy there were questions which needed to be answered and if necessary sums redone. she said serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive. we need to know that the money is there not just for this year or next year but into the future so that older people and those who are looking forward to older age can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.,0
sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish football association is awaiting referee hugh dallas's report before acting against hearts winger saulius mikoliunas. mikoliunas 20 barged linesman andy davis who had advised dallas to award rangers an injurytime penalty in hearts's 21 defeat at tynecastle. he was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we don't know if he did something else after the whistle. we don't know how many red cards he was shown said an sfa statement. hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch. rangers' striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving the hearts keeper on the ground. the sfa said once the referee's report comes in then we'll immediately look at things. we don't normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we're well aware of what happened here. prso was sent off for two cautions and that will just be a onematch suspension. the sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southampton's david prutton was banned for 10games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan wiley. hearts' boss john robertson said mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee's chest and got a red card for it. the officials have got to take into account the fact he's a young lad. but people have got to take into account why he was incensed. why were 10000 hearts fans incensed why did nobody from the rangers' bench claim for a penalty kick rangers' boss alex mcleish accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off. mcleish said i'm glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end  literally with dado trying to get the ball back from craig gordon. but it was overzealousness and i don't think hugh had any option.,1
howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research saying it is important people are not frightened of the future. the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election where george bush opposed extending it. but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer's parkinson's and motor neurone disease. i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney heart or even brain tissue. mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued we mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past  we must be optimistic about the future. politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid70s society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. i know many people are concerned about stemcell research. they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. i respect those concerns. but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson's multiple sclerosis motor neurone disease alzheimer's and  as we saw in the papers today  now possibly heart problems. mr howard acknowledged there were no easy answers over such an issue but it was necessary to have the courage to do what we know to be morally right. he added of course stem cells are still a recent discovery. more research needs to be done. but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grownup way. the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved. former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women's committee on ambitions and values.,0
iaaf will contest greek decision the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou. the highprofile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation segas last month. now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport cas and has suspended both athletes. an iaaf statement said the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous. the statement continued both athletes' cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas. the decision in both cases will be final and binding. segas said the iaaf appeal was expected and understandable. now we are going to await the final result which we cannot prejudge said segas chairman vassilis sevastis. kenteris who won olympic 200m gold at the 2000 olympics and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games. however the independent tribunal overturned those bans clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify antidoping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics. kenteris' lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf's decision as not unexpected but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly. the iaaf's timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions said ioannidis. the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements testimonies the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes. we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth. kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer's olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august. the pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair. thanou and kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident,1
game warnings 'must be clearer' violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing the trade and industry secretary has said. patricia hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on sunday. she is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. parents are expected to spend millions on video games as christmas presents. violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14yearold stefan pakeerah who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother giselle said her son's killer warren leblanc 17  who was jailed for life in september  had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating the stefan's murder dismissed its influence and manhunt was not part of its legal case. ahead of sunday's meeting in london ms hewitt said she was proud of the uk's vibrant games industry but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults. roger bennett head of gaming industry body elspa said banning violent games would be wrong. he said we don't want to go down that route. we have seen that the government is supportive of the industry. the government is holding a further meeting on friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the british board of film classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer. ms hewitt said adults should be treated as adults and children as children. it is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors. equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children. video games are different to films or videos and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do. we need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement. her call was backed by culture media and sport secretary tessa jowell who said you wouldn't let your child watch the texas chainsaw massacre. you wouldn't let them go to a strip club. so you shouldn't let them play an 18rated game. it's the same principle  adults can make their own informed choices but children can't always and need to be protected. anyone convicted of selling an 18rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to 5000. rockstar games the makers of manhunt has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults.,0
jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performanceenhancing drugs. the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking 25m 13m in the suit. conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said i stand by everything i said. jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performanceenhancing drugs. conte's statements the suit added were false and malicious. after the abc television program earlier this month jones' lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performanceenhancing drugs. victor conte is a man facing a 42count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america's most decorated female athletes. mr conte's statements have been wildly contradictory. mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination. mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed. the sport's ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to conte's allegations but contacted the us antidoping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information. but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added. the us antidoping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its antidoping war. and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest. jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us antidoping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march.,1
wrightphillips to start on right england coach svengoran eriksson has revealed shaun wrightphillips will start against the netherlands. but wrightphillips will not make his first start for england playing on the left as had been widely expected. shaun wrightphillips will probably start the game said eriksson. but i'm not going to start wrightphillips on the left. eriksson also revealed that wes brown will start alongside jamie carragher in the injuryhit centre of defence. when asked if brown and carragher would start eriksson replied i could tell you yes. it's a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries. on the other hand it's good for carragher and brown to show what they can do at this level. that's positive. the england coach said that he had been impressed by wrightphillips' form for manchester city. he deserves his chance. he has been playing well all season and i look forward to seeing him. and he added that andy johnson and stewart downing  the other two new players in the squad  would also get a chance to impress. wrightphillips downing and johnson will start or get the chance to play some part. johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals. downing is another one making a great season. he is young talented and there are not too many leftfooted players in the squad.,1
us duo in first spam conviction a brother and sister in the us have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited email messages to aol subscribers. it is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors. jurors in virginia recommended that the man jeremy jaynes serve nine years in prison and that his sister jessica degroot be fined 7500. they were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk emails using fake addresses. they will be formally sentenced next year. a third defendant richard rutkowski was acquitted. prosecutors said jaynes was a snake oil salesman in a new format using the internet to peddle useless wares news agency associated press reported. a fedex refund processor was supposed to allow people to earn 75 an hour working from home. another item on sale was an internet history eraser. his sister helped him process credit card payments. jaynes amassed a fortune of 24m from his sales prosecutors said. he's been successful ripping people off all these years ap quoted prosecutor russell mcguire as saying. jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100000 emails in 30 days virginia state attorney general jerry kilgore reportedly said. prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for jaynes and a jail term for his sister. but jaynes' lawyer david oblon called the nineyear recommended term outrageous and said his client believed he was innocent. he pointed out that all three of the accused lived in north carolina and were unaware of the virginia state law. spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60 of all emails sent.,2
candela completes bolton switch bolton boss sam allardyce has signed roma defender vincent candela on a fivemonth deal. the 31yearold former france international gave his last press conference as a roma player on monday anouncing his move to bolton. i have signed a fivemonth contract with bolton said candela who will travel to england on tuesday. in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football. allardyce hopes candela's arrival will relieve bolton's injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldham's 10 win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday. in light of what has happened to nicky hunt with his injury it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highlyexperienced fullback to help with our injuries at the back allardyce said. he has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the world cup in 1998. he has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the premiership. he can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately rightfooted he has played the majority of his career at leftback. candela who was a member of the roma side that won the title in 2001 has made only seven league appearances this season for luigi del neri's side.,1
xbox 2 may be unveiled in summer details of the next generation of microsoft's xbox games console  codenamed xenon  will most likely be unveiled in may according to reports. it was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of xbox's successor at the game developers conference gdc in march. but a microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at gdc. sony microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months. the next xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year but very few details about it have been released. it is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the electronic entertainment expo e3 in los angeles which takes place in may according to a reuters news agency report. e3 concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers marketers and retailers. the gdc is aimed more at game developers. microsoft chief bill gates used the gdc event to unveil the original xbox five years ago. since its launch microsoft has sold 19.9 million units worldwide. at the consumer electronics show earlier this year there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine. in his keynote speech mr gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. but the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers' hearts and thumbs will be extremely hardfought. sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its playstation 2. but earlier this year microsoft said it had reached a european milestone selling five million consoles since its european launch in march 2002. hit games like halo 2 which was released in november helped to buoy the sales figures. gamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power. they are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs. although details of playstation 3 xenon and nintendo's socalled revolution are yet to be finalised developers are already working on titles. rory armes studio general manager for games giant electronic arts ea in europe recently told the bbc news website in an interview that ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. microsoft had delivered development kits to ea but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo's kits. but he added the playstation 3 was rumoured to have a little more under the hood than xbox 2.,2
middlesbrough 22 charlton a late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough a battling draw with charlton at the riverside. matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off franck queudrue. but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser. shaun bartlett's strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue's pass to head home. the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. hreidarsson received danny murphy's freekick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him. charlton's early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his rightfooted strike. szilard nemeth recalled in place of josephdesire job was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely. the striker played a great onetwo with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper's arms. boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure  with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar  to take their lead into halftime. it was all oneway traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson's blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal. but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott's equaliser in the 74th minute. the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate's misdirected effort but despite the charlton protests his goal stood. the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing picking up hreidarsson's cross to easily sink his rightfooted strike. but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. the 19yearold striker nodding home the equaliser  and his first premiership goal  with five minutes left on the clock. i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre. we dominated after the break the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win. but for charlton goalkeeper dean kiely who made three tremendous saves we could have scored five or six. to take the lead and then to get penned back it feels a little bit like a defeat admitted kiely. we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. but we stood up and credit to us we didn't capitulate. we'll kick on now. our shortterm ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year. nash reiziger graham 82 riggott southgate queudrue parlour job 86 doriva nemeth parnaby 87 zenden downing hasselbaink. subs not used cooper knight. riggott 74 graham 86. kiely hreidarsson perry el karkouri young konchesky murphy euell 78 holland kishishev thomas johansson 72 bartlett. subs not used fish jeffers andersen. konchesky hreidarsson perry. holland 14 bartlett 80. 29603 m riley w yorkshire.,1
ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer's motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united. the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid. a lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart said ferdinand. no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table. the central defender added on bbc radio five live we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with. i would like to see the situation resolved either way. i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals. the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch. glazer currently owns a 28.1 stake in the club and united's statement to the stock exchange said the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject. the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer. a further announcement will be made in due course. glazer's previous bids for the club which united supporters opposed were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 28.9 of the club to succeed. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake while fans remain opposed to his involvement.,1
tories 'would cut number of mps' the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about onefifth if they were elected tory leader michael howard has said. the plan forms part of the party's smaller government bill to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly. the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election mr howard told the paper. the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall  labour by more than 80000 and the tories by almost 100000  they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced but what about ministers parliament and special advisers he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the state. mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70000 people mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66000 in wales just over 59000 and in scotland 53000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. you have got to have a big bang. we don't want this like the house of lords reform getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.,0
online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr. existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the thinktank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate. in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebaytype model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection. what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website. a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication  like a prelegislation discussion. the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of edemocracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist. it mentions goodpractice public initiatives like the bbc's ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues. but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online. they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peertopeer interaction online. at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies. but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities. the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members. using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. this could mean a civic commons would work within a nonmarket system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publiclyrecognised rules. egovernment initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues. with 53 of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy. government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online. but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic nonmarket interactions said mr davies. there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added. the paper is part of the ippr's digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain.,2
'ultimate game' award for doom 3 scifi shooter doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony the golden joystick awards. it was the only title to win twice winning ultimate game of the year and best pc game at the awards presented by little britain star matt lucas. the muchanticipated scifi horror doom 3 shot straight to the top of the uk games charts on its release in august. other winners included grand theft auto san andreas which took the most wanted for christmas prize. only released last week it was closely followed by halo 2 and halflife 2 which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month. but they missed out on the prize for the most wanted game of 2005 which went to the nintendo title the legend of zelda. the original doom released in 1994 heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3d graphics. it helped to establish the concept of the firstperson shooter. doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around 15m 8.3m. the top honour for the best online game of the year went to battlefield vietnam. the chronicles of riddick escape from butcher bay was handed the unsung hero game of 2004. its release was somewhat eclipsed by doom 3 which was released on the same week. it was however very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. electronic arts was named top publisher of the year taking the crown from nintendo which won in 2003. the annual awards are voted for by more than 200000 readers of computer and video games magazines. games awards like this have grown in importance. over the last six years the uk market for games grew by 100 and was worth a record 1152m in 2003 according to a recent report by analysts screen digest.,2
apple attacked over sources row civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation eff has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple. apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products including the mac mini. the eff representing the reporters has asked california's superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product codenamed asteroid and has asked the journalists' email providers to hand over communications relevant to that. rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege headon apple is going to the journalist's isps for his emails said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters. if the court lets apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary he said. the case began in december 2004 when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org. apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com the internet service provider of powerpage's publisher jason ogrady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple including professor tom goldstein former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor a wellknown silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.,2
tmobile bets on 'pocket office' tmobile has launched its latest pocket office thirdgeneration 3g device which also has builtin wifi  highspeed wireless net access. unlike other devices where the user has to check which highspeed network is available to transfer data the device selects the fastest one itself. the mda iv released in the summer is an upgrade to the company's existing smartphone the 2.5gwifi mda iii. it reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. the device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer or as a conventional clamshell phone. the microsoft mobile phone with two cameras and a qwerty keyboard reflects the design of similar allinone models released this year such as motorola's mpx. one in five european workers are already mobile  meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office rene obermann tmobile's chief executive told a press conference at the 3gsm trade show in cannes. he added what they need is their office when they are out of the office. tmobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls office in a pocket devices with 100000 mdas sold in europe already. in response to demand tmobile also said it would be adding the latest phoneshaped blackberry to its mobile range. reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office it announced it would introduce a flatfee 20 38 a month wifi tariff for people in the uk using its wifi hotspots. it said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots  places where wifi access is available  globally from 12300 to 20000. it also announced it was installing highspeed wifi on certain train services such as the uk's london to brighton service to provide commuters a fast net connection too. the service which has been developed with southern trains nomad digital who provide the technology begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early march to the end of april. a full service is set to follow in the summer. wifi access points will be connected to a wimax wireless network  faster than wifi  running alongside the train tracks. brian mcbride managing director of tmobile in the uk said we see a growing trend for business users needing to access email securely on the move. we are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey. he said this was something other similar intrain wifi services such as that offered on gner trains did not offer yet. mr obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in cannes france for the 3gsm which runs from 14 to 17 february.,2

lasers help bridge network gaps an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country. tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. the laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. in 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations. in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task said mr r. sridharan vice president of networks at tata. heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult he said. in some locations he said permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. this has led chennaibased tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata's core network and the premises of customers. the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps 2000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 12mbps. the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate. it's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy he said. in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working said mr sridharan. once we get the other permissions normal time period for set up is a few hours he said. by contrast he said digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. this speed of set up has helped tata with its aggressive expansion plans. just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. but by the end of march the firm hopes to reach more than 1000. speed is very important because of the pace of competition said mr sridharan.,2
weir poised for sunderland move larne's teenage star robbie weir is poised to join sunderland after turning down a move to stoke city. the 17yearold irish league midfielder was also being chased by rangers and fulham but mick mccarthy's side appear to have won the race. but larne boss jimmy mcgeough has yet to confirm that weir is on his way from inver park. i heard on sunday that he has joined sunderland but not from the lad himself he said. ''robbie has an agreement with larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs. ''personally i would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the fulltime game. ''he has been on trial with a number of clubs. but it would be great to see him making it at sunderland.'',1
apple laptop is 'greatest gadget' the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc. the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an alltime top 100 list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts andor electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a selfcontained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device. in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine. in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded. the oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 a.d. and put in 60th place. other preelectronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 59th position the marine chronometer from 1761 42nd position and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 28th position. the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player diamound multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv10 and mobile phone motorola startac. the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13. sony's third entry in the top 20 is the cdp101 cd player from 1983. who can forget the crystalline hissfree blast of madonna's like a virgin emenating from their first cd player asked the magazine. karl elsener's knife the swiss army knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone 23rd the nintendo gameboy 25th and the pulsar quartz digital watch 36th. the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser 98th 1980s toy tamagotchi 86th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler 84th. why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda's  laptops etc. what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it's time a technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it. a laptop computer is not a gadget it's a working tool the sinclair executive was the world's first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well. how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors. are the people who created this list insane  surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly. has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc  the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible. what's an apple powerbook 100  it's out of date  not much of a gadget. surely it has to be something simple  timeless  the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves  it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule. the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off. all top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current hightech obsession than anyhting else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20. sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multitakings os. shame the marketing was so bad apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. utter rubbish. yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition. i'd also put apple's newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc's flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time. psion organiser series 3 should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable. case design was good batteries in the hinge  a first i think. great product innovation. the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it's obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that. the motorola startac should be number one. why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices. the psion series 3c the first most practical way to carry all your info around... i too would back the sinclair spectrum  without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now. i'd have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model. sinclair spectrum  16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what i do for a living now. i wish more modern notebooks  even apple's newest offerings  were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses. they're invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use. congratulations to apple a deserved win,2
pavey focuses on indoor success jo pavey will miss january's view from great edinburgh international cross country to focus on preparing for the european indoor championships in march. the 31yearold was third behind hayley yelling and justyna bak in last week's european cross country championships but she prefers to race on the track. it was great winning bronze but i'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season she said. because of previous injuries i don't even run up hills in training. pavey who came fifth in the 5000m at the athens olympics helped the british cross country team win the team silver medal in heringsdorf last week. she is likely to start her 3000m season with a race in either boston or stuttgart at the end of january.,1
musicians 'upbeat' about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found. the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against filesharing. while most considered filesharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders. even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden. for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of 2755 musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004. they ranged from fulltime successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website. we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented. the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of 10 going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web. more than 80 offered free samples online while twothirds sold their music via the net. independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly. musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden. they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright. perhaps surprisingly opinions about online filesharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry. through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us. it found that most artists saw filesharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal. free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report. it's hard to keep making records if they don't pay for themselves through sales. however 60 said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. many suggested that rather than fighting filesharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it. both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden.,2
chelsea sack mutu chelsea have sacked adrian mutu after he failed a drugs test. the 25yearold tested positive for a banned substance  which he later denied was cocaine  in october. chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for mutu a 15.8m signing from parma last season who may face a twoyear suspension. a statement from chelsea explaining the decision readwe want to make clear that chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs. mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho. chelsea's statement added this applies to both performanceenhancing drugs or socalled 'recreational' drugs. they have no place at our club or in sport. in coming to a decision on this case chelsea believed the club's social responsibility to its fans players employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules. the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases. fifa's disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a sixmonth ban. and the sport's world governing body has reiterated their stance over mutu's failed drugs test maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it said a fifa spokesman. chelsea's move won backing from drugtesting expert michelle verroken. verroken a former director of drugfree sport for uk sport insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club. it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october 18 and although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. the football association has yet to act on mutu's failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.,1
el guerrouj targets cross country double olympic champion hicham el guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the world cross country championships in france. but the moroccan who has not raced over cross country for 15 years will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 march. if i am to compete in it it is only if i feel i can win said the 30yearold who is retiring in 2006. otherwise there is not much point in me going. el guerrouj achieved a lifetime ambition last august when he clinched his first olympic titles over 1500m and 5000m. but the fourtime world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career. the 30yearold has set his sights on clinching the world 5000m crown in helsinki this summer. and he is aiming to break 10000m olympic champion kenenisa bekele's 5000m and 10000m world records. el guerrouj could meet bekele in march as the ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses. but the moroccan will not commit himself to the st galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going. the return to training was very difficult because i accepted a lot of invitations these past few months said el guerrouj. i am almost a month behind but i am on the right track.  britain's paula radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the world cross country championships. i haven't quite decided what events i will compete in prior to london but the world cross country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility said the twotime champion.,1
'friends fear' with lost mobiles people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends. more than 50 of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. more than half 54 of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book. a fifth rely entirely on mobiles. about 80 of uk adults own at least one mobile according to official figures. it is estimated that 53 of over 65s own a mobile according to intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. most 15 to 24yearolds 94 and 25 to 34yearolds 92 own at least one. nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced. the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. many mobile owners do not bother to make backups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem. they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead. we're a nation of lazy soandsos david noone from intervoice said. we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart. one in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. most 62 said they had no idea what their partner's number was. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide backup services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. generally information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. sim backup devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds. but some operators offer customers free webbased backup services too. orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means backups of address books and other data are created online. for nonsmartphone users a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. o2 also offers a free webbased syncing service which works over gprs and gsm. neither vodafone or tmobile currently offer a free network service for backups but encourage people to use sim backup devices. it is thought that about 10000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50 of total street crime involves a mobile. mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. globally more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004 26 more than the previous year according to analysts. it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.,2
greene sets sights on world title maurice greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his olympic 100m title in athens by winning a fourth world championship crown this summer. he had to settle for bronze in greece behind fellow american justin gatlin and francis obikwelu of portugal. it really hurts to look at that medal. it was my mistake. i lost because of the things i did said greene who races in birmingham on friday. it's never going to happen again. my goal  i'm going to win the worlds. greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind gatlin who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. but greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semifinals. in my semifinal race i should have won the race but i was conserving energy. that's when francis obikwelu came up and i took third because i didn't know he was there. i believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and while i was in lane seven i couldn't feel anything in the race. i just felt like i was running all alone. i believe if i was in the middle of the race i would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me. greene was also denied olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch britain's mark lewisfrancis on the final leg. the kansas star is set to go headtohead with lewisfrancis again at friday's norwich union grand prix. the pair contest the 60m the distance over which greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. he then has another indoor meeting in france before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in helsinki in august. greene believes gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in finland. but he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. there's always someone else coming. i think when i was coming up i would say there was me and ato boldon in the young crowd greene said. now you've got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.,1
pakistani women 'must not hide' hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of islam president musharraf of pakistan has said during a visit to britain. he was speaking to the bbc's newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the pakistani community in manchester. my wife is travelling around. she is very religious but she is very moderate said general musharraf. it comes after pakistan's high commissioner to britain said some pakistanis should integrate more. dr maleeha lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves. gen musharraf told the bbc some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out  absolutely wrong. the pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe. yes absolutely. and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems so therefore we can never address it in its totality he said. we are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic longterm context. it is the political disputes and we need to resolve them and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty. this combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism. on monday the pakistani president met prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street on his first official visit to london. he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon. the mirror newspaper said on tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of gen musharraf's visit to britain. the paper said the document had been found in a london street by a member of the public. it said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels call signs and codes. speaking in london on monday gen musharraf said alqaeda was on the run in pakistan. but standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the core of what creates terrorists what creates an extremist militant environment which then leads on to terrorism. that is the resolution of political disputes. mr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan the wider war on terror the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir. we agreed that in afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there said mr blair. in respect of iraq we agreed that whatever the issues of the past the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.,0
wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. dr brian gibbons on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked admitted big challenges but insisted the essentials were in place. but both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. meanwhile ms hutt defended her record saying waiting times and lists were only 10 of the health agenda. dr gibbons who was a gp in blaengwynfi in the upper afan valley before becoming am for aberavon said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after tremendous change and reform. one of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her fiveandahalf years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales. in november the british medical association said nhs staff were weeping with despair as figures showed 311000 people were waiting for treatment in wales up by 2400 on the previous month. in the same month lists in england were at their lowest for 17 years with 856600 people waiting for treatment. dr gibbons told radio wales there is no doubt that in managing waiting lists england has done a lot of very very useful work and we do need to learn from that. but he said the nhs in wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health and a balanced view of priorities was important. we do need a consistent acrosstheboard approach recognising the patients' experience of how they use the service is going to be at the end of the day the main test of how the service is working. he said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after tremendous change and reform. later dr gibbons praised the work of ms hutt saying he agreed with everything she's done to change the health service in wales. dr gibbons said he accepted there was a problem but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. he also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out the rest of the assembly government's health policy would be overshadowed. opposition members and some labour mps had long called for ms hutt's removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times. first minister rhodri morgan told bbc wales he had agreed with ms hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the runup to the 2007 elections. she's been doing the job for five years and eight months and apart from nye bevan himself architect of the nhs i don't think anybody has ever done the job for so long. mr morgan said he had only told ms hutt of the reshuffle on monday morning and said the nhs in wales was dr gibbons' baby now. in response to dr gibbons' comments ieuan wyn jones leader of the plaid cymru group in the assembly said it is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking titanic. kisrty williams for the lib dems added if the underlying policy is going to continue then changing the minister will serve no purpose other than to deflect flak from labour's mps she said. meanwhile ms hutt said she hoped that the people of wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months asked about waiting lists she said that waiting times and lists were only 10 of the health agenda and that the welsh assembly government had turned the corner on the issue.,0
china net cafe culture crackdown chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the country's government said. according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use. the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china. rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december. china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to. net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes. this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. logs of sites people visit are also kept. laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.,2
blunkett sorry over murder plan david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws. the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess. he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences. the home office has already said the review will begin next year. on wednesday a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales. news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday. but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday. he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself. but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps. in its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence. but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. the commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146  among them 21 judges  believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease. a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence. the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.,0
turkey deal 'to help world peace' a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world tony blair has said. the deal struck at the european council last week also proved claims of a clash between muslims and christians were wrong mr blair said. it represented the achievement of an historic british objective he added. tory leader michael howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the eu was antiislamic. turkey's involvement with the eu would provide an invaluable bridge between europe and the rest of the world mr howard added. but the tory leader argued that the eu constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as turkey. mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. he insisted that the turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line. it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join and entry cannot be guaranteed. if it joins turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however talks will begin only if the country cooperates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.,0
itunes user sues apple over ipod a user of apple's itunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an ipod to play songs. he says apple is breaking anticompetition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. apple which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the ipod in 2001 uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod. californian thomas slattery filed the suit in the us district court in san jose and is seeking damages. apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice the lawsuit states. the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market according to ernest gellhorn an antitrust law professor at george mason university. as a practical matter the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims prof gellhorn said. apple has sold more than six million ipods since the gadget was launched and has an 87 share of the market for portable digital music players market research firm npd group has reported. more than 200 million songs have been sold by the itunes music store since it was launched. apple has unlawfully bundled tied andor leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players and viceversa the lawsuit said. mr slattery called himself an itunes customer who was also forced to purchase an apple ipod if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to. a spokesman for apple declined to comment. apple's online music store uses a different format for songs than napster musicmatch realplayer and others. the rivals use the mp3 format or microsoft's wma format while apple uses aac which it says helps thwart piracy. the wma format also includes socalled digital rights management which is used to block piracy.,2
costin aims for comeback in 2006 jamie costin should be paralysed. he says so himself in a matteroffact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the 50k walk. there is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry driving on the wrong side of the road had ploughed into his rental car. i was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken says the waterford man. but i was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. in my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i'd be able to race. it took over 10 hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics. my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so i'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. i'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake. jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident. for the first nine hours i had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. but once i got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking'ok i've got a different set of circumstances now'. within three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulance. doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home  something he is now very relieved about. the greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. that would have fused all my lower back and i would never have been able to race again. they were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. but when i got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. the people at the mater have been absolutely fantastic. jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back. he then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 january. walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery. physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. needles get put right close up to my spine. a two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and i'm fairly incapacitated today as a result. jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years. i was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. basically there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing. jamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twicedaily physio sessions and poolwork. all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. it's all about trying to get mobility in my back. lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. there's a lot of work involved in my recovery. i'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. i'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. i'm fairly full on with everything i do. i'd hope to be training regularly by march. but training is just part of the process of getting back. at the moment every time i go and do a big bit of movement my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. it's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. hopefully after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.,1
microsoft launches its own search microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its homegrown search engine. the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003. the revamped engine indexes more pages than before can give direct answers to factual questions and features tools to help people create detailed queries. microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries. google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query keep up with news or search for images. but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals such as yahoo and microsoft and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information  be it for a particular web page recipe book gadget news story image or anything else. microsoft is keen to make its homegrown search engine a significant rival to google. to generate its corpus of data microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days  more often than rivals. the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer. for its direct answer feature microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions facts calculations conversions and solutions to equations. tony macklin director of product at ask jeeves pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april 2003. the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search so in many ways microsoft is following the market he said. tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites countries regions or languages. microsoft is also using socalled graphic equalisers that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more uptodate or more popular. the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. the test or beta version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles. on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.,2
guantanamo pair's passport ban the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports. a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi the men's solicitor says. it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january  richard belmar and moazzam begg  have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men's passports. it is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947  the last time was in 1976. the letter from the home office says i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that on leaving the united kingdom you would take part in activities against the united kingdom or allied targets. the home office said it could not comment on individual cases. the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay. home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time. he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament. amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on torture evidence obtained at guantanamo bay. furthermore we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay said director kate allen. the men's solicitor louise christian has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy condemns and prohibits torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi 23 from croydon south london was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in 2001. mr mubanga 29 from north london was originally detained in zambia.,0
blair returns from peace mission prime minister tony blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the middle east to try to resurrect the peace process. mr blair held talks with his israeli counterpart ariel sharon and the palestinian leader mahmoud abbas. he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march. mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week. the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah  the first world leader to do so. he nodded briefly towards the tomb rather than lay a wreath in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute. the bbc's paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas also known as abu mazen who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on 9 january. at a news conference following talks with mr blair mr abbas said the british prime minister was in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit. he added your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose. in an interview with the bbc's political editor andrew marr mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be tough but at least we have got the first step. mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism. he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationallyagreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process not the end of it. earlier mr sharon again said he had not seen the slightest step the palestinians were working to end terror attacks  though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. before visiting israel mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city. he was briefed on preparations for the national poll which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed.,0
security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser. the revamp has been prompted by microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of techsavvy criminals. test versions of the new program called ie 7 are due to be released by the summer. the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates microsoft chairman and chief software architect during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant mr gates said ie7 would include new protections against viruses spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information. in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6 microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes  some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft antispyware program. an ownbrand antivirus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a uturn because before now microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows codenamed longhorn which is due to appear in 2006. the current version of internet explorer is four years old and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004. estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory firefox's market share is now about 5 of all users. however other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90 but this is down from a peak of almost 96 in mid2004.,2
offcolour gardener storms to win britain's jason gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at sunday's leipzig international meeting. gardener clocked 6.56 seconds to equal the meeting record and finished well ahead of germany's marc blume who crossed the line in 6.67 secs. the world indoor champion said i got to the airport and my stomach was upset and i was vomiting. i almost went home. i felt a little better sunday morning but decided i'd only run in the main race. then everything went perfectly. gardener part of the great britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the athens olympics will now turn his attention to next weekend's norwich union european indoor trials in sheffield. given i am still offcolour i know there is plenty more in the tank and i expect to get faster in the next few weeks he said. it's just a case of chipping away as i have done in previous years and the results will come. scotland's ian mackie was also in action in leipzig. he stepped down from his favoured 400m to 200m to finish third in 21.72 secs. germany's alexander kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with dutchman patrick van balkom second in 21.58 secs. there were plenty of other senior british athletes showing their indoor form over the weekend. promising 60m hurdler clocked a new uk record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in norway. the 24yearold reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former aaa champion diane allahgreen in the final.  who broke onto the international scene at the olympic games last season set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in ghent. that leap  37cm short of brazilian winner jadel gregorio's effort  was good enough to qualify for the european indoor championships. at the same meeting finished third in 7.27 seconds in a highclass women's 60m. the event was won by european medal favourite christine arron of france while belgium rival kim gevaert was second. britain's joice maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. olympic bronze heptathlon medallist made a lowkey return to action at an indoor meeting in birmingham. the 28yearold cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the women's shot put.,1

google's toolbar sparks concern search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to preselected commercial websites. the autolink feature comes with google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon.com if it finds a book's isbn number on the site. it also links to google's map service if there is an address or to car firm carfax if there is a licence plate. google said the feature available only in the us adds useful links. but some users are concerned that google's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon. autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage  even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission. if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique isbn number would link directly to amazon's website. it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon.com whether they like it or not. websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. dan gillmor founder of grassroots media which supports citizenbased media said the tool was a bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth. in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. it said the user can choose never to click on the autolink button and web pages she views will never be modified. in addition the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time. the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users. it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service. some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to a commercial site. cory doctorow european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance. of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. but as an end user i would want to know  'can i choose to use this service 'how much is google being paid' 'can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google'. mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or tricked into using the service.,2
chepkemei joins edinburgh lineup susan chepkemei has decided she is fit enough to run in next month's great edinburgh international cross country. the kenyan was initially unsure if she would have recovered from her gruelling tussle with paula radcliffe in the new york marathon in time to compete. but she has declared herself up to the task and joins a field headed by world cross country champion benita johnson. race director matthew turnbull said susan will add even more strength in depth to the worldclass line up. chepkemei who won the six kilometre event three years ago when it was staged in newcastle endured an epic battle with radcliffe in the big apple until the briton outsprinted her in the final 400m. tirunesh dibaba of ethiopia will defend the title she won last year in tyneside  before the race was moved north of the border. recentlycrowned european cross country champion briton hayley yelling also competes in edinburgh on 15 january as does inform scot kathy butler.,1
jones medals 'must go if guilty' world antidoping agency wada chief dick pound says marion jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances. victor conte of balco laboratories claims the american sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance. if she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years said pound. asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken pound said that is not an issue at all. however under international olympic committee ioc rules athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event. jones who won five medals at the 2000 olympics denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over conte's allegations. balco laboratories is the firm at the centre of a widereaching investigation into doping in the us. pound continued if she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people.,1
smith aims to bring back respect scotland manager walter smith says he wants to restore the national team's respectability in world football. smith has joined his first squad for a threeday gettogether near manchester in preference to playing a friendly. while qualification for the 2006 world cup appears to be beyond scotland smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive. i think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can he said. we will have to approach each game differently. obviously we will have to approach the italian game away from home in a different manner to moldova at home. we have to meet the challenge of each match. smith meeting a number of his squad for the first time brought them together on monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation's fortunes. he said i pointed out how i see the international team going forward and that was the main topic. this is a relaxed gathering and i don't think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists. a 25man squad will spend the next three days based at the mottram hall hotel in cheshire and will train at manchester united's nearby carrington complex. smith will be absent for the final sessions however as he is due to fly out to sardinia on wednesday to watch italy's friendly with russia.,1
souness eyes summer move for owen newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen. he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on. michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we're monitoring him he told bbc newcastle. he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i don't think we're the only ones monitoring the situation at real. souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn's club scoring record may influence the striker's decision. milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness. i can't imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn's scoring record. souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window. the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling. the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. i'm after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said. don't think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now',1
johnson edges out rival sotherton jade johnson edged out rival kelly sotherton with her last effort to claim the aaas long jump title at the norwich union european indoor trials. olympic heptathlon bronze medallist sotherton led the event with her first leap of 6.43m  a personal best. but johnson who has not competed indoors for five years leapt to a lifetime best of 6.50m in her last jump after four fouls. both johnson and sotherton passed the european championships qualifying mark. although sotherton's main aim in madrid next month will be the pentathlon where she will take on olympic heptathlon champion carolina kluft. ireland's delivered a shock in the men's 200m as he stormed to his first major title in 21.01 seconds. british favourite chris lambert had to settle for second place while defending champion ireland's paul brizzel took third. there was some consolation for lambert as he set a personal best of 20.94 in the first round  good enough to qualify for europe. twotime aaas champion allyn condon and ian mackie had no such luck as they were disqualified in the heats. there was plenty of hot action in the men's 60m hurdles where scotland's was vying for top spot with olympian andy turner. scott 22 smashed his personal best on the way to the final where he broke it again to win the aaas title in 7.58 seconds. turner finished second in 7.82 after previously setting a personal best on the 7.83 in the semifinals while damien greaves did not finish the final. the trio of athletes have reached the european qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a callup to the british squad. comfortably defended her 3000m title clocking eight minutes 49.87 seconds to easily surpass the european qualifying mark. the european cross country bronze medallist is ranked number one in europe this season and will go to madrid with high hopes. helen clitheroe was agonisingly close to the 905.00 qualifying mark as she claimed the runnersup spot in a personal best of 905.73. in the men's 800m heats qualified fastest in the 800m heats to lay down a challenge to inform . the welsh runner attacked the last 200m to come through ahead of james thie in one minute 49.87 seconds. mcilroy who is third in the european rankings eased across the finish in 150.87 to set up a showdown in sunday's final in sheffield. both watkins and mcilroy have already achieved the european qualifying mark. scotland's susan deacon stole 's thunder in the final of the women's 200m. fraser became the fastest british woman over the distance this season when she qualified for the final in 23.68 seconds  though that time is outside the european standard. but deacon claimed her first aaas title over the distance edging fraser into second in 23.67. in the women's shot put veteran claimed her fourth aaas title with a throw of 15.27m. but that mark was not good enough for the 39yearold to book her place at next month's european indoor championships in madrid. sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of 13.77m. in the absence of injured british number one carl myerscough claimed the men's shot put title with a throw of 17.64m which was below the qualifying mark. sale's robert mitchell climbed to a season's best of 2.20m  just 3cm short of the european standard  to claim the british indoor high jump title. could only clear 2.16m to finish in fourth but the 27yearold's disappointment will be tempered as he had already achieved the qualifying mark at a meeting in slovenia on tuesday. there was bad luck for british number one in the pole vault as he failed to clear the bar after deciding to come in at 5.45m. the aaas indoor title went instead to ashley swain who climbed to a season's best of 5.25m and ireland's taniesha scanlon set a new national record of 13.28m in the women's triple jump.,1
domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned. the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force. but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif. domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. socalled ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so for example website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'. but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name idn system said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent mr dyer said. although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer. it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site he added. there are solutions. for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. another solution to introduce idndisabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said. centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees. a rush to introduce idndisabled browsers into the marketplace is an overlyzealous step that will harm public confidence in idns  a technology that is desperately needed in the nonenglish speaking world the organisation said in a statement.,2
chelsea ridiculed over complaint barcelona assistant coach henk ten cate has branded chelsea's expected complaint to uefa as pathetic. the blues are poised to complain about an alleged halftime incident during wednesday's 21 loss at the nou camp. the source of chelsea's anger was an alleged talk between barca boss frank rijkaard and referee anders frisk who later dismissed didier drogba. to react the way chelsea have is pathetic. mourinho lied with the lineups and now this ten cate said. uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the halftime break. spokesman william gaillard said frisk says rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game. we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it. the referee's dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in. indeed it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat. uefa delegate thomas giordano added the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference. the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa  weakening chelsea's case. rijkaard was critical of mourinho's decision not to speak to the media after the match. there was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game. it is not good behaviour after a match he said. maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is. i really don't understand it. i am very calm about it. barca midfielder deco formerly managed by mourinho at porto agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge a protest. it's not normal behaviour on his part. it was not logical he did not give a news conference he said. rijkaard added chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the english league and they defend very well so i am very pleased with the win. my men deserved victory and i am pleased to have won this match. i congratulate my players.,1
savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits. the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. it also shows that few can spot the difference between paidfor results and organic ones. the report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online. almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. a significant chunk of net users 36 carry out a search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks. for 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find. search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. according to pew research 44 of searchers use just a single search engine 48 use two or three and a small number 7 consult more than three sites. tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. a small number 17 said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist. the remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites. more than twothirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paidfor results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results. commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.,2
radcliffe proves doubters wrong this won't go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula's career. but as a test of character it was the toughest race she's ever taken part in. a win in the new york marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. if paula's last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. even if she'd lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. she knows she can dig deep if she needs to. it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. and although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of paula's best times it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course. i was speaking to paula in the leadup to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a nowin situation. she thought that if she won people would say why couldn't she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and 10000m in athens. but that was never on the cards. she might have been beaten but she would have kept running. the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens  the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions  weren't at play here. the only question was what position she could finish in. most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paula's mind. if she wasn't confident she wouldn't have run. after all if you're the best in the world at an event you'll always have expectations of winning. now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year have a wellearned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.,1
google launches tv search service the net search giant google has launched a search service that lets people look for tv programmes. the service google video beta searches closed caption information that comes with programmes. it only searches us channel content currently. results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken. it should expand over time to include content from more channels said a google spokesperson. the first version of the service is part of google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond. we think tv is a big part of people's lives said jonathan rosenberg google's vice president of product management. ultimately we would like to have all tv programming indexed. google video has been indexing usbased programmes from pbs the nba fox news and cspan since december. but there were few clues from google about when more global broadcasters would be included. over time we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via google video but don't have more product details to share with you today a google spokesperson told the bbc news website. the results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel date and time. it also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a us zip code search function. rival search engine yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and tv clips which it promotes from its homepage. it offers direct links to websites with movies or other clips relevant to the search query but does not pinpoint when the search query occurred. a spokeswoman told the financial times on monday that yahoo was adding captioning for bloomberg bbc and bskyb broadcasts. a smaller service blinkx.tv was launched last month. it searches for and links to tv news film trailers and other video and audio clips.,2
microsoft gets the blogging bug software giant microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging. it is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs or online journals called msn spaces. microsoft is trailing behind competitors like google and aol which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. blogs short for web logs have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online. msn spaces is free to anyone with a hotmail or msn messenger account. people will be able to choose a layout for the page upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. the service will be supported by banner ads. this is a simple tool for people to express themselves said msn's blake irving. this is microsoft's first foray into blogging which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. competitors like google already offer free services through its blogger site while aol provides its members with journals. accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. according to blog analysis firm technorati the socalled blogosphere has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. it now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.,2
new 'yob' targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight antisocial behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday. ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many antisocial behaviour orders asbos were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago ministers launched their antisocial behaviour plan and thursday's figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2600 antisocial behaviour orders were issued by the courts  more than double the total used in the previous four years. police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved. prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly. he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. we have not defeated this problem by any means but shown together what can be done he will say. mr blair this week defended the shakeup of the licensing laws saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance. ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25000 community support officers csos. but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that about a third of asbos were breached  with some people jailed and others not.,0
web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanishlanguage music. but what you will not find is much spanishlanguage hiphop. hiphop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanishspeaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now a us company is bringing rap and hiphop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico's hottest hiphop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hiphop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanishspeaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio. you can't really just go on the radio and listen to hiphop in spanish... it's just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california. it's really hard for the spanish hiphop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world. millan and two friends set out to change that  they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally. mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all it is webbased radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hiphop tracks. the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap. the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hiphop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage. but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina's mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. he's considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hiphop scene millan says. he really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanishspeaking world. currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10 as is cuban artist papo record. every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now mexico leads the way accounting for about 50 of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well  about 25 of the web station's traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanishlanguage rap and hiphop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hiphop production. that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences. but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hiphop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against 20 emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact. it's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says. and it's pretty much true. he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it's amazing. latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hiphop and rap. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction.,2
owen determined to stay in madrid england forward michael owen has told the bbc he is happy in spain and has no plans to quit real madrid to return to the premiership in the near future. but the 25yearold who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in la liga did not rule out a return to the premiership at some stage. i'm pleased with the start i've made here he told bbc radio five live. england is my country. it's definitely part of me but who knows whether if or when i'll be playing there again. owen who moved to the bernabeu from liverpool last summer has grabbed 11 goals for real but has been unable to replace raul or ronaldo in the starting lineup. however he said he was delighted with the way his time in spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join real. when i first came there was a lot of scepticism back in england any maybe some out here he said. people were saying 'fourthchoice striker what are you going there for you'll be sat on the bench all the time'. but as much as our press like to build it up as if i've permanently had my backside on the bench i've played as many games as anyone else in the team this year. for a fourthchoice striker at the start i'm more than happy with the way i've settled in. recent speculation has linked owen with a move back to england with newcastle expressing their interest but the england striker said he is not ready to return home. he added i've got nothing against the premiership i mean that's where i first performed that's where i made my name. i can't keep my eyes off the premiership on television when i'm at home. when asked if it would have to be liverpool if he returned owen said i've not really given it much thought. i've got great memories of liverpool. no matter what happens it'll always be a club i have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart. it's very flattering to be linked to top clubs in england  i'm glad that noone is forgetting me but i couldn't have wished for a better start in madrid.  listen to the full interview with garry richardson on bbc radio five live's sportsweek at 0900 gmt on sunday.,1
camera phones are 'musthaves' four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year says a report from analysts gartner. globally the number sold will reach 159 million an increase of 104. the report predicts that nearly 70 of all mobile phones sold will have a builtin camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly musthave buy. in europe cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific where camera phone technology is much more advanced mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology and the uptake there is huge. by 2008 according to gartner 95 of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them. camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms multimedia messaging services. this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways they have introduced more design features like rotating screens and viewfinders removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages. mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites or mobile blogs  moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid2005 it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality and up to six megapixels on a highend camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorlylit conditions like nightclubs. other developments include wideangle modes basic editing features and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists. the exhibition fonetography will feature images taken by photographers david bailey rankin and nan goldin and artists sir peter blake tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel samsung the uk's foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. according to recent figures sony ericsson's profits tripled in the thirdquarter because of new camera phones. over 60 of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras it said.,2
broadband challenges tv viewing the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months with the web eating into tv viewing habits research suggests. just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband up from 34 million a year ago according to market analysts nielsennetratings. the total number of people online in europe has broken the 100 million mark. the popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from tv say analysts jupiter research. it found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching tv in favour of the net the report by nielsennetratings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60 over the past year. the biggest jump was in italy where it rose by 120. britain was close behind with broadband users almost doubling in a year. the growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of alwayson fastnet subscription plans. twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in europe now they are more than 50 and we expect this number to keep growing said gabrielle prior nielsennetratings analyst. as the number of highspeed surfers grows websites will need to adapt update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones. the total number of europeans online rose by 12 to 100 million over the past year the report showed with the biggest rise in france italy britain and germany. the ability to browse web pages at high speed download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time. a study by analysts jupiter research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits. in homes with broadband 40 said they were spending less time watching tv. the threat to tv was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up in particular the uk france and spain said the report. it said tv companies faced a major longterm threat over the next five years with broadband predicted to grow from 19 to 37 of households by 2009. yearonyear we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where when and how europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for tv newspaper and radio said jupiter research analyst olivier beauvillian.,2
mallon wades into ne vote battle middlesbrough mayor ray mallon has been drafted in to boost the yes campaign as the north east assembly referendum enters its final week. the former police chief dubbed robocop for his zero tolerance style clashed on thursday with sunderland no campaigner neil herron. mr mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. but mr herron said north east people did not want or need an assembly. the pair met on the platform at sunderland station as mr mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. but mr herron  who gained fame as one of sunderland's metric martyrs and is running his own no campaign alongside the official north east says no campaign  said he was not convinced by mr mallon's arguments. the reality is that it is not going to deliver he said. labour has had twoandahalf years to convince people of this. if you can't sell a deal in that time it is a bad deal. on wednesday mr mallon provoked fury by branding the official no campaign twobit tories in a confrontation outside its durham headquarters. the campaign is being run by twobit conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the north east they are interested in hitting the labour party over the head he said. mr mallon is a late recruit to the yes campaign after rejecting overtures from no campaigners including he claims tory leader michael howard. most local observers believe the contest is too close to call although little recent polling has been carried out. yes campaign chairman john tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout  something he says will boost their cause. he added the government exerts a lot of political power in the north east. the accountability should be in the north east as well. he also defended the decision to attack the official no campaign's alleged political allegiances. we felt we had to show what people were behind the no campaign  london tory spin doctors. graham robb spokesman for north east says no said the yes campaign's decision to get personal dragged the campaign into the gutter and showed they were rattled. and he hit back at mr mallon's claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region. it can push paper around but it can not get people moving he said. some 487939 people had returned their ballot papers by wednesday  a turnout of 25.7. the deadline for voting is next thursday 4 november.,0
pompeii gets digital makeover the oldfashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computergenerated images that bring the site to life. a european unionfunded project is looking at providing tourists with computeraugmented versions of archaeological attractions. it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii. it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism. the technology would allow digital people and other computergenerated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site. the lifeplus project is part of the eu's information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting userfriendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage. engineers and researchers working in the europewide consortium have come up with a prototype augmentedreality system. it would require the visitor to wear a headmounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. at pompeii for example the visitor would not just see the frescos taverns and villas that have been excavated but also people going about their daily life. augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming. this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games said professor nadia magnenatthalman of the swiss research group miralab. we are for the first time able to run this combination of software processes to create walking talking people with believable clothing skin and hair in realtime she said. unlike virtual reality which delivers an entirely computergenerated scene to the viewer the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company 2d3. andrew stoddart chief scientist at 2d3 said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life. the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computergenerated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life he said.,2
attack prompts bush site block the official reelection site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons. the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective. many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses. the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website. scott stanzel a spokesman for the bushcheney campaign said the measure was taken for security reasons. he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. the barring of nonus visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. in early october a socalled denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs. the attack made the site unusable for about five hours. about the same time the web team of the bushcheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. akamai uses a webbased tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based. typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name. ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bushcheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site. the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney have failed. by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. mike prettejohn netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the runup to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however simply blocking nonus visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military's own portion of the net. akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites.,2
'brainwave' cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. the results show that people can learn to use scalprecorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed. brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. the impressive noninvasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a noninvasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partiallyparalysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in braincontrol experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.,2
mandelson warning to bbc the bbc should steer away from demonising exdowning street media chief alastair campbell peter mandelson has said. the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour dirty tricks campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell's campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street sexed up iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier. the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies directorgeneral greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard's past. mr mandelson a former labour communications director told bbc radio 4's today programme i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda. in my experience of these things parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics the trivialisation of the campaign. i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone concentrate on the issues as i say not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell  we all know where that led before. mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour which denies engaging in personal campaigning. conservative cochairman liam fox said mr campbell's return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard  recently withdrawn from the party's website  were a sign of abusive politics. the government despite the fact that they would say want to go forward not back seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly about the future he said on sunday. labour peer baroness kennedy who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might she said.,0
mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief roundup follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia's ngage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles. there are shootemups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tiein. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost 5. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available  even the ones that use 3d graphics. the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth shortrange radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. too fast too furious digital bridges as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games  because i'm rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. fatal force macrospace a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoonlike but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right powerup you can go into a matrixstyle bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps.,2
tory backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards. the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc. the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats. they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues' concerns over id cards. the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it. the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven't id cards they are going to be detained.,0
souness delight at euro progress boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen. an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them a 21 win and a place in the uefa cup last 16. obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage he said after the 42 aggregate victory. we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous. shearer's goal moved him within 12 of jackie milburn's club scoring record of 200 for the magpies. but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season. i think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway he added. he struck the ball very well  he always has done  and i think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper. souness also paid tribute to laurent robert who was at the heart of much of united's attacking play. in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. more of the same in future please he said.,1
holmes urged to compete at worlds jolanda ceplak has urged britain's kelly holmes to continue competing at the major championships. double olympic gold medallist holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year's worlds and is undecided about next month's european indoors. but world indoor 800m record holder ceplak said there is never an easy race when she is in the field. there is only excitement at what might happen. it is good for the sport. she always fetches the best out of everyone. ceplak has been a great rival of holmes' during the briton's career and the pair fell out when holmes questioned the manner of the slovenian's runaway 800m victory at the 2002 european championships. but the controversy has since been forgotten with ceplak acting as pacemaker for holmes' failed attempt on the british indoor 1500m record at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham in 2003. ceplak added i like running against her  you know the race is always going to be fast. that is the sort of competition that i like. she is special to me. she was like my idol from the beginning of my career. meanwhile ceplak will be looking to follow up last saturday's win in boston with a fast time and victory in friday's night of athletics in erfurt germany. britain's jason gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in leipzig on sunday. gardener's decision means scotland's 400m man ian mackie will carry british hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend's norwich union european trials in sheffield.,1
desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday. the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 51 at the nou camp in the champions league quarterfinal second leg in 2000. things will be totally different this time he told bbc sport. now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona. chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarterfinal tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 31 courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg going down to strikes from rivaldo 2 luis figo dani and patrick kluivert. former chelsea captain desailly who is now playing for algharafa in qatar says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team who are top of the premiership. mentally they are much stronger even though a lot of their players are young the 36yearold said. we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000  a lot of them were individual mistakes. it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality. world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for 4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. the whole of chelsea is different now  the chairman the manager and all the players he said. everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. since that game in 2000 chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season. desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar alongside the likes of frank lebeouf josep guardiola titi camara gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday  paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta. i'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level he said. i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays i will continue to play. and it's amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.,1
end bush 'denial' blair tells eu tony blair is urging european leaders to wake up from their state of denial over president bush's reelection. america has spoken. the rest of the world should listen the prime minister said in an interview with the times newspaper published on friday. mr blair is at a summit in brussels where iraq and european justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. french president jacques chirac reacted to his warning by saying europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. mr blair has probably been closer to president bush than any other european leader. he said some people were in a sort of state of denial about the us election result but predicted a more receptive mood would emerge soon. america needed to listen to the world too he said. the fact is that president bush is there for four years. he is there because the american people have chosen him he argued. he also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together. britain was uniquely placed to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the us he suggested. he admitted he had gone to bed at 2230gmt well before the american polls closed thinking mr kerry might have won. he woke up at 0530gmt to discover mr bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. his words about president bush met a cool reception from jacques chirac. the french president told reporters europe today has more than ever the need the necessity to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity. that is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multipolar than ever. mr chirac will miss an address to the summit from iraqi interim leader iyad allawi who this week criticised nations which took a spectator role to iraq's reconstruction. mr chirac denied there was any snub  he is going to a memorial service for the united arab emirates' late leader and says he would be happy to meet mr allawi. he also signed a communiqu233 stressing the eu's commitment to securing a stable and unified iraq. the eu also confirmed a new 21m aid package. the communiqu233 congratulated president bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. the summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline european asylum and immigration decisions. mr blair recently said the uk would only participate in euwide measures where it was in uk interests but the tories say he is surrendering a key veto. the meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in lisbon in 2000 to make europe more competitive.,0
security warning over 'fbi virus' the us federal bureau of investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via emails that purport to be from the fbi. the emails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. the messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the fbi's internet fraud complaint center. an attachment in the email contains the virus the fbi said. the message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. but rather than being a questionnaire the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer according to the agency. it is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited emails or from people they do not know. recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the fbi does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited emails to the public in this manner the fbi said in a statement. the bureau is investigating the phoney emails. the agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts used to communicate with the public because of a security breach. a spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated.,2
ukip candidate suspended eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston 54 was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views including the return of the british empire were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip soon after the highprofile departure of mep robert kilroysilk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to lawabiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said we're looking for the resurrection of the british empire. the problems for the human race  environmental and others  can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the englishspeaking nations which they are uniquely able to do. mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston's reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. it is simply a distraction from the task in hand the eu constitution not individual idiocies. mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying i feel ukip have overreacted and overshot the runway. peter nielson who is ukip scotland chairman said he had suspended mr houston on friday night. he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken. he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added i can't comment too much at the moment i have one version from him but i haven't seen the papers yet.,0
radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs paula radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals. the marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the suspicions and innuendoes which greet any fast time. doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such the 30yearold told the sunday times. it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters sponsors and the general public. radcliffe's comments come at a time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. being caught in possession of a performanceenhancing drugs should carry a penalty she added. the current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes. this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. often when an athlete puts in a good performance they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise. having been on the receiving end of accusations like this i can testify as to how much this hurts.,1
the force is strong in battlefront the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its backtobasics approach and immense nostalgia quotient. geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of allout gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies. previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise's extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves. the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or firstperson perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player's personal propensity for good or evil. there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a firedup luke skywalker. in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. it really is no more complicated than that. locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical atats on the march. there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedi's muchmaligned ewoks lived. the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. it is worth noting though that on the playstation 2 the game's graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version. the pivotal element behind battlefront's success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of largescale war. the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over. speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy's audio motifs. the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up. there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long. the gameplay is reliable bogstandard stuff short on originality. there are also odd annoyances like the game's insistence on respawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non userfriendly they prove. whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. the aboveaverage ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. battlefront's novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty onetrickpony of a game. but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas' stable.,2
software watching while you work software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrongdoing has been unveiled. worries about cybercrime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. the developers behind the system claim it is a breakthrough in the way data is monitored and stored. but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. the system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists bridgehead software. they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hitech crime unit nhtcu a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than 80 of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cybercrime. bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with. ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to cd floppy disk memory stick or flash card. other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric logins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. that is not the case said tim ellsmore managing director of 3ami. it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof he said. people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data he added.,2
tory leader 'cleared' over work scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest. the edinburgh msp earns up to 30000 a year from the law firm tods murray where he is a partner. mr mcletchie said he has taken advice from holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare. he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. as an msp mr mcletchie signed a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport. it then emerged tods murray has a client which opposes the development. mr mcletchie then sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. bbc scotland's political correspondent glenn campbell said no complaint had been made against mr mcletchie but questions were raised about his dual role. glenn said msps are advised to guard against a conflict of interests and a perception of a conflict. mr mcletchie said i'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case that the judgement i took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded. he said nothing had changed in respect of his work with the law firm and it was a matter he would have to discuss with the other partners at tods murray. the firm and i have a very good working relationship and we have done for the last six years said mr mcletchie. i don't suppose i'll be working forever as a lawyer or a politician. i deserve to retire from both but i'm not willing to put time limits on them.,0
owen delighted with real display michael owen revelled in his return to the to the real madrid starting lineup and inspired a 31 win over real betis on wednesday by scoring the first goal. he said i am happy i could play a game from the start again. i felt good all though the game and it is obvious that i am happy to have scored another goal. people have talked a lot about my performances and i think i have had some months that were not so good and others that were very good. owen starting his third successive la liga match converted a low cross from santiago solari. robert carlos made it 20 at the break smashing home an indirect freekick. midfielder edu reduced the deficit after halftime but ivan helguera headed past keeper antonio doblas to seal victory for his team. victory took real to within six points of leaders barcelona and owen is confident real can close the gap. he added we had several chances against betis and i think we can get back in touch with barcelona. it is only six points between barcelona and us and that is nothing. if we can beat them at the bernabeu on 10 april then it will be just three. owen has scored nine league goals one behind real's top scorer ronaldo. real had lost their previous two league games.,1
highbury tunnel players in clear the football association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the arsenal and manchester united game. arsenal's patrick vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened gary neville before the 42 defeat. vieira also clashed with opposing skipper roy keane and referee graham poll had to separate them. the referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time said an fa statement. it means united's win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body whose new chief executive brian barwick was in the highbury stands. i didn't threaten anybody. they are big enough players to handle themselves said vieira. i had a talk with roy keane and that's it. gary neville is a big lad he can handle himself. they just played better than us and deserved to win. neville admitted there had been incidents before the game but insisted it had not distracted his focus. there were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you he said. especially from players of that calibre but it's a tough game and we've been around a long time. neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of mikael silvestre for headbutting freddie ljungberg . i thought it was a horrible game in the first half and it was not much better in the second he said. there is no way that should have happened in a football match. after the match keane accused vieira of starting the row. patrick vieira is 6ft 4in and having a go at gary neville. so i said 'have a go at me' he said. if he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that gary neville is an easy target i'm not having it. manchester united manager sir alex ferguson added vieira was well wound up for it. i've heard different stories. patrick vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that.,1
bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester city's paul bosvelt will find out within a month whether he is to be offered a new oneyear deal. the 34yearold dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and although his age may count against him he feels he can play on for another season. i told the club i would like to stay for one more year. they promised me an answer within the next month so i am waiting to see he said. the main concern is my age but i think i have proved i am fit enough. bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england. but his professionalism and dedication impressed manager kevin keegan. he realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. he is an unsung hero said keegan.,1
dundee utd 41 aberdeen dundee united eased into the semifinal of the scottish cup with an emphatic win over aberdeen. alan archibald prodded united ahead in 19 minutes and james grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. richie byrne's header gave aberdeen a way back into the game but stevie crawford restored united's lead from 18 yards before half time. the scoring was completed by grady just after the break  a superb shot on the turn making it 41. tony bullock in the united goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarterofanhour on the clock. noel whelan laid the ball off to jamie winter on the edge of the box but his firsttime effort was gathered by the united keeper. moments later though the home side took the lead. barry robson whipped in a free kick from the right which stevie crawford caught on the volley. russell anderson failed to deal with it and whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of archibald who poked the ball into the net. united doubled their lead after 29 minutes when grady tapped the ball into an empty net after robson had headed mark wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. but only three minutes later aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. a free kick from the left by winter was met powerfully by the head of byrne at the back post leaving bullock helpless. united restored their twogoal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. jason scotland played a perfectlyweighted pass into the path of the onrushing crawford and he coolly beat ryan esson from 18 yards. united ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. grady received a pass from crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of esson. the home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from esson to keep out robson's drive after 62 minutes. the keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area. robson saw another longrange effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line. bullock duff wilson ritchie archibald scotland samuel 63 brebner kerr cameron 87 robson crawford grady. colgan dodds kenneth. brebner. archibald 19 grady 29 crawford 41 grady 47. esson hart anderson diamond byrne morrison 75 mcnaughton heikkinen foster 27 winter clark stewart 51 mackie whelan. blanchard mcguire.  anderson diamond. byrne 33. 8661 k clark,1
digital guru floats sub100 pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit's media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than 100 53. he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be  very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood. he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. the second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. we put in 25 laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it's also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook. mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years we're talking about months. he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. in china they spend 17 per child per year on textbooks. that's for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.,2
iaaf to rule on greek sprint pair greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are expected to find out on wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer. the international association of athletics federations iaaf council held a conference call on tuesday and are set to announce their decision. kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years. the duo withdrew from the olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. their former coach christos tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date. however the iaaf will determine the sprinters' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. the sport's ruling body is expected to direct the greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport. the sprinters both sent written explanations to the iaaf which have been taken into account. the iaaf sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach tzekos after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete where they had said they would be. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago when they decided to fly back to greece early. just before the olympics the pair dramatically missed another test in athens before withdrawing from the games. kenteris 31 won gold in the 200m at the sydney olympics in 2000 where thanou 29 won silver in the 100m.,1
blair and blunkett sheffield trip tony blair is to join home secretary david blunkett in a visit to sheffield on thursday. mr blunkett's conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his exlover. the parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give kimberly quinn free rail tickets. he is also being investigated over the visa application of mrs quinn's exnanny. the visit to sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by mr blair. on wednesday during prime minister's questions tory leader michael howard went on the offensive over comments mr blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. he is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. mr howard said mr blunkett had complained he had inherited a giant mess when he took over at the home office from jack straw now foreign secretary. the tory leader went on he doesn't stop there he thinks the culture secretary's weak he thinks the trade secretary doesn't think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn't developed as expected. he says the prime minister doesn't like being told the truth and the chancellor  no doubt the prime minister will agree with this  is a bully. mr blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians. the home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets given to him as an mp to mrs quinn and has since paid the 180 back. he has apologised for a genuine mistake and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. the rail tickets are meant to help mps' spouses get between westminster and their constituencies. after his inquiry parliamentary watchdog sir philip mawer will report to the commons standards and privileges committee the group of mps who will recommend to the full house of commons what action  if any  should be taken against mr blunkett. the separate inquiry by exsenior civil servant sir alan budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fasttrack a bid by mrs quinn's nanny leoncia casalme to stay in the uk. last week mr blunkett won the first round of a high court battle with mrs quinn for access to her son. mr blunkett declined to comment about his own position saying the inquiry was under way and the high court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. downing street has stressed mr blair's support for the home secretary.,0
lib dems 'to target stamp duty' the liberal democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election in a bid to court firsttime house buyers. vince cable the party's treasury spokesman said raising the threshold to 150000 would prevent over 400000 homebuyers from paying the tax. he said firsttime buyers were being squeezed out of the housing market. the labour party said the liberal democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. the plan forms part of a wider lib dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market. under the proposals the average saving for a new buyer would be more than 1000 according to mr cable. first time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net he said. by failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold gordon brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest. by pledging to increase the threshold to 150000 the liberal democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax. paul boateng mp labour's chief secretary to the treasury said the lib dems' sums don't add up. they can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments. mr cable will publish his alternative budget on monday.,0

microsoft seeking spyware trojan microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's antispyware software. the spyware tool was only released by microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. stephen toulouse a security manager at microsoft said the malicious program was called bankasha trojan and was being sent as an email attachment. microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an antivirus program. the program attempts to disable or delete microsoft's antispyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users. it may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes. microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. earlier this week microsoft said it would buy antivirus software maker sybari software to improve its security in its windows and email software. microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paidfor antivirus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. the antispyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware  programs which monitor internet use causes advert popups and slow a pc's performance.,2
ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal's thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze. ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united's controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy's foul on ashley cole for which he got a threegame ban. we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before halftime when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry following the ball attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze's head. the striker protested his innocence  and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two archrivals and praised his own side's behaviour. edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential legbreaker he said. there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal seven on heinze five on ronaldo six by vieira  and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. phil neville got booked for his first challenge. i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. we have always been good at being gracious in defeat. what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement but then they do it all the time don't they,1
blunkett tells of love and pain david blunkett has spoken of his love for married publisher kimberly quinn for the first time. the home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility. mr blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to mrs quinn's twoyearold son. she denies he is mr blunkett's. the interview with bbc radio sheffield was made before allegations he fasttracked a visa for mrs quinn's nanny. the allegations which he has denied are being investigated by sir alan budd. mr blunkett talked about how he fell in love  but that she resisted his desire to go public. in an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences even when they were painful. mr blunkett told bbc radio sheffield i fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer and then the news of the world picked up the story. i tried for three years to make something work. i haven't spoken about it and i don't intend to. even in the biography that's being written about me i've ensured that there's as little as possible. bbc political correspondent carole walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary. shadow home secretary david davis says mr blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly. reports have claimed mr blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny leoncia casalme's wait. the home office has said it would be up to sir alan's inquiry to decide if any such meeting was relevant. home office minister fiona mactaggart said she hoped mr blunkett would survive in his job. i work with him every day and i have always been surprised by how focused he is on the job in hand on working to deal with things she said. she told bbc one's breakfast with frost programme he is just really down for the job and i hope he does survive.,0

junk emails on relentless rise spam traffic is up by 40 putting the total amount of email that is junk up to an astonishing 90. the figures from email management firm email systems will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their inboxes. while virus traffic has slowed down denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. virus mail accounts for just over 15 of all email traffic analysis by the firm has found. it is no longer just multinationals that are in danger of socalled denial of service attacks in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. email systems refers to a small ukbased engineering firm which received a staggering 12 million emails in january. the type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months according to email systems analysis. half of spam received since christmas has been healthrelated with gambling and porn also on the increase. scam mails offering ways to make a quick buck have declined by 40. january is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities said neil hammerton managing director of email systems. spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar he said.,2
seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently in the gulf of mexico is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric id cards the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. along with the owner's picture name and personal details the new seafarers' identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year in line with the revised un convention on seafarers' identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers produced by different companies in different countries are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities will be published by the international labour organisation ilo by the end of november. crystal cruises which operates the crystal harmony is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenticorp the us technology consultancy has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. if you're issued a seafarer's id in your country you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in say my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed authenticorp's ceo cynthia musselman told the bbc's go digital programme. she said french jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world said ms musselman. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are in fact seafarers.,2
eu china arms ban 'to be lifted' the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections uk foreign secretary jack straw has said. the 15yearold ban was imposed in the aftermath of china's crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square. mr straw told a commons select committee human rights concerns over china remained. but he said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma. in december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. the eu's move was welcomed at the time by beijing which described the embargo as a product of the cold war. german chancellor gerhard schroeder and french president jacques chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious on the issue but on wednesday mr straw said he also wanted it to end. i have long understood china's argument that to lump them in with say burma and zimbabwe is not appropriate and i don't think it is he told the joint committee on strategic export controls. he said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july. but he said an eu code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. if it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to china as we have now. mr straw said the us government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the eu in wanting the ban lifted. but he said many of washington's objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries. and intense discussions were taking place with us officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by china to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. us officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the eu code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. us undersecretary of state john bolton is meeting british officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.,0
stuart joins norwich from addicks norwich have signed charlton midfielder graham stuart until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee. it was a very easy decision to make the 34yearold told norwich's website. the attraction for me was to continue to play in the premiership. canaries boss nigel worthington added i'm delighted that graham will be joining us until the end of the season. he's gives us a wealth of experience. hopefully he can be part of keeping us in the premier league. stuart has extensive topflight experience with everton chelsea and charlton and can play across the midfield positions. he joins norwich with the norfolk club secondfrombottom in the premiership but stuart is confident that the carrow road outfit have a bright future. i've been very impressed with the facilities here. it's obviously a very well run football club with excellent facilities and i've always enjoyed playing at carrow road he added. it's a nice compact ground with a good atmosphere and hopefully i can help give the fans something else to cheer. stuart a former england under21 international made 110 appearances for chelsea scoring 18 goals before joining everton. he won the fa cup with the toffees in 1995 and remains a hero at goodison park after his 81stminute winner against wimbledon saved everton from relegation in 1994. stuart spent just over four years at goodison park making 125 senior appearances and scoring 25 goals before signing for sheffield united  where he scored 12 goals in 68 appearances. after signing for charlton he made 164 appearances scoring 23 times but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the londoners for three months before heading to norwich.,1
2004 an irish athletics year 2004 won't be remembered as one of irish athletics' great years. the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics  or to be more accurate the lack of it. sonia o'sullivan's olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous buildup to the games we shouldn't have been surprised. at the start of the year an o'sullivan had been earmarked as ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that 10000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombard's shattering of mark carroll's national 10000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a twoyear ban from the sport. back at preolympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldn't have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5000m final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the women's 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shakeup. as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a worldclass field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an outofform and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit. james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injuryplagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 339 was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee's athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injuryravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders teammates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december. a large turnout of athleticsloving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy's many friends. as only death can it put the year's athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.,1
mobiles double up as bus tickets mobiles could soon double up as travel cards with nokia planning to try out a wireless ticket system on german buses. early next year travellers in the city of hanau near frankfurt will be able to pay for tickets by passing their phone over a smartcard reader already installed on the buses. passengers will need to own a nokia 3220 handset which will have a special shell attached to it. the system would reduce queues and make travelling easier said nokia. transport systems around the world are seeing the advantage of using ticketless smartcards. using a mobile phone is the next step said gerhard romen head of market development at nokia. the ticketless trial will start early in 2005 and people will also be able to access transport information and timetables via their phones. nokia has worked with electronics giant philips to develop a shell for the mobile phone that will be compatible with hanau's existing ticketing system. the system opens up possibilities for mobile devices to be interact with everyday environments said mr romen. it could be used in shops to get product information at busstops to get information about the next bus or for example by being passed over an advert of a rock star to find out details of concerts or get ringtones he told the bbc news website. he is confident that the trial being run in germany could be extended to transport systems in other countries. the technology offers access to a lot of services and makes it easy to get the information you want he said.,2
clarke to press on with id cards new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to pause for thought from charles kennedy. the lib dem leader said david blunkett's resignation was a good opportunity to question whether the legislation was necessary. but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now. id cards are a means to creating a more secure society he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been significantly influenced by the recommendations of the commons' home affairs committee. the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy whose party opposes the id cards plan as deeply flawed said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio 4's today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors. wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary a new broom to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government's plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision. they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven't id cards they are going to be detained. the home office says people will pay 85 for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card. the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards although not to carry them. the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to 1000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to 2500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.,0
ronaldo considering new contract manchester united winger cristiano ronaldo said he is close to agreeing to a new contract at old trafford. the portugal star who joined in august 2003 on a fiveyeardeal is a regular in the united firstteam. the united board have already made an offer to renew the contract but i'm trying not to think about it he told the news of the world. my agent has spoken with the club and it will be resolved soon. i think we'll reach a good agreement for both sides. ronaldo refused to commit his longterm future to the club. nobody knows what will come tomorrow. i like being here but who knows he added. there aren't many bigger and better clubs than this one. it's my ambition to be at a big club. i'm happy but nobody knows the future.,1
relay squad thrilled with honours jason gardener says being made an mbe in the new year honours list underlines the achievement of great britain's 4x100m relay squad at the olympics. gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis have all been awarded mbes after beating prerace favourites usa to gold. i think this award reinforces what we did on that fantastic night he said. this recognition is really inspiring and makes me want to have more success said lewisfrancis. the british sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the americans. and when the usa stumbled with a poor switch between justin gatlin and coby miller at the 300m stage britain edged ahead going into the final bend. then on cue lewisfrancis ran a textbook final leg holding off maurice greene to bring team gb home in 38.07 seconds  just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far said the birchfield harrier. this award is not just for me but for all my friends family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport. gardener added all of us had worked very hard for a long long time to carry off what most believed was an impossible task. of course this award is very special but for me nothing will ever take away winning an olympic gold medal. it's all i ever wanted. all my life that is what i dreamed of doing. life since then has been fantastic. campbell agreed receiving the honour capped off what has been a difficult year for the sprinter. i think the mbe is important because the people closest to me know my journey said the newportbased athlete. i've not just stumbled upon this. it gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something.  there was also recognition for james clarke chairman of the london marathon. he becomes an obe.,1
microsoft makes antipiracy move microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features. the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid2005. it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates but their options would be limited. microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs. either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft's site. those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and addons that the software giant offers. people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number. microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newlyfound security flaws are important because they stop worms viruses and other threats penetrating pcs. some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats with more pcs left unprotected. but graham cluley senior consultant at security firm sophos told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision. it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net he said. windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september 2004 for englishlanguage versions of windows. microsoft's windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. software piracy has cost the company billions it says. the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware which 90 of pcs are infected with. the virusfighting program updated monthly is a precursor to microsoft's dedicated antivirus software. last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project a ukbased pilot scheme which ran from november to december. the scheme meant that anyone with preinstalled copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free. it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china norway and the czech republic where pirated software is a huge problem by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows. china in particular is a problem with piracy estimated at 92 said mr cluley.,2
ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of highprofile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mouldbreaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm's preeminence in an increasinglycompetitive mobile gaming market. nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while startup companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in midnovember priced 150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million preorders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters  a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine's wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a topdown map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful recreation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new minigames and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds's key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,2
tomlinson stays focused on europe long jumper chris tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the european indoor championships. the 23yearold has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in madrid and lievin this week as well as warmweather training in lanzarote. it's nothing serious said his coach peter stanley. he strained a muscle in his abdomen at the birmingham meeting but is back in full training. sprinter mark lewisfrancis will also not compete in madrid on thursday. the birmingham athlete who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in birmingham last week also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's european indoor championships. lewisfrancis who was runnerup to british teammate jason gardener at the europeans three years ago will continue his training at home. meanwhile tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in madrid. the middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the birmingham grand prix  good enough to push world indoor champion savante stringfellow into second.,1
broadband in the uk growing fast highspeed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever. bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe. according to figures gathered by industry watchdog ofcom the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that resell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl  the uk's most widely used way of getting broadband  beyond 6km. asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps though faster connections are available. this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pentup demand that existed in many areas said paul reynolds chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms resell. bt retail which sells net services under its own name also had a good quarter and provided about 30 of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition and dwindling influence in other sectors. local loop unbundling llu in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office is growing steadily. cable  wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using socalled carrier presection cps services such as talktalk and one.tel which route phone calls across nonbt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4.,2
visa row mandarin made sir john the top civil servant at the centre of the david blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the new year honours. sir john gieve was home office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with mr blunkett quitting. he and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for mr blunkett's exlover's nanny came to be fasttracked. the outgoing head of the troubled child support agency doug smith also earns an honour in the new year's list. mr smith 57 whose retirement was announced by work and pensions secretary alan smith in november is made a commander of the order of bath. both men were giving evidence to a commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments when the announcement was made. the knighting of sir john 54 will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians. the liberal democrats said it beggared belief he and fellow officials could not remember how leoncia casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from mr blunkett's office to the head of the immigration and nationality department. meanwhile the conservatives accused officials of a collective failure of memory. but sir alan budd who led an inquiry into the affair said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information. downing street defended the decision to honour both men with a spokesperson saying you have to look at their whole career. sir john was made permanent secretary in april 2001 following a civil service career which dates back to 1974. he has also worked in the treasury and the department of employment. a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said of mr smith's honour the award reflects all that he has achieved in a civil service career principally in the inland revenue spanning over 40 years  not just his role as chief executive of the child support agency. in his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes. mr smith is set to stay on at the csa until march. less controversial will be the knighthoods for derek wanless and mike tomlinson who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. former natwest chief executive mr wanless 57 has delivered not one but two major reports on the nhs. exchief inspector of schools mr tomlinson 62 has recommended replacing alevels and gcses with a new diploma system in a shakeup of the exams system.,0
piero gives rugby perspective bbc sport unveils its new analysis tool piero at the wales v england rugby union match on saturday. but what does it do and how does it work picture the scene  wales are camped on the england line in the dying seconds of the six nations' opening match. a ball is flung out to winger shane williams who crosses to score the winning try for wales. but the england players are incensed  arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. in the past sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. but bbc sport's new tool piero could end discussions in minutes. piero named after the italian painter and pioneer of perspective piero della francesco creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. the technology has been created by bbc research and development for bbc broadcast and bbc outside broadcasts. bbc sport is the first client to start using the system. in order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life said andrew thompson the bbc's head of development new media and sports news. we want to appeal to core fans  to give them more analysis more detail more definitive answers about key passages of play. piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a pc which can then render the information into 3d graphics. the more cameras using piero the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3d models. it allows us to tell the story of a passage of play tracking individual players across the field looking at tactics said andy townsend from bbc broadcast. an operator can manipulate the information and provide almost realtime replays of incidents as well as more indepth analysis. the virtual camera can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail  from the length of kicks to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. mr townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. bbc broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways  from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.,2
lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered the lib dems say. sir alan budd's inquiry linked the exhome secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his exlover's nanny. but he could not say whether mr blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. he told bbc news i'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. that must be bad for government it must be bad for public confidence in the system. mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. he said there is a strong case for a judgeled judicial review of this because of course next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that. so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved. the tories criticised the lib dem stance saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged. but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.,0
'brainwave' cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. the results show that people can learn to use scalprecorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed. brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. the impressive noninvasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a noninvasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partiallyparalysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in braincontrol experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.,2
tories attack burglar 'uturns' tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing uturns over rules on using force against burglars. the government has ruled out amending the present law which allows reasonable force in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable saying it is not householders who should be frightened it's the burglars. home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law. metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps if we get the right response from those people we will of course support a change in the law. instead the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday mr howard told bbc radio 4's today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said we've had three policy positions in three months and two uturns. it's not surprising gordon brown told him 'there's nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.' mr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16yearold burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder said mr clarke. he said the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it  that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making. the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar tied him up beat him and set him alight he said. tory mp patrick mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.,0
learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson. one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work. i can sit in a caf233 or a library with or without a wifi connection and research and write articles. if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform. and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a children's writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network. but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection. we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again. she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem. this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday. with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dialup connection on her daughter's laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection. as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dialup. she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively. but the impact spread into her personal life too. she did not take her children to the cinema during halfterm because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas. she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website. and she did not know where to go fossilhunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google. of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils. but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things. she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone. according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004 and numbers are climbing fast. there will certainly be five million by the end of the year. dialup users are switching to broadband. my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason. it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere. people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do. they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity. of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world. in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with. but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient. it may not be the brave new world of streaming fullscreen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now. and it is certainly better than slow access or no access. just ask anne. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,2
petrol duties frozen brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his prebudget speech to the commons on thursday. mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial year because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen. during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. he said it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services. but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties. the rac welcomed the news calling it an early christmas present for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists. we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman. in 2000 the people's fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slowmoving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year but despite threats of more protests in 2003 he added 1.28p per litre.,0
putting a face to 'big brother' literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hitech gadgets. imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour and perhaps even alert you to new emails. basic versions of these socalled avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london's science museum as part of its future face exhibition. one such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man which you can download for free and install in your computer. his creator richard bowden lecturer at the centre for vision speech and signal processing at the university of surrey refers to jeremiah as him rather than it. jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. he is very childlike he likes visual stimulus he told the bbc news website. when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him he smiles at them. if you ignore him he gets angry. if you leave he gets sad. and you can also even surprise him. jeremiah is not actually intelligent. it works on vision reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. it is not able to talk or to hear you at least not yet. the surrey team is already working on jeremiah's next version that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature finn the fish. i am interested in the interaction providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that explained dr bowden. the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hitech gadgets. experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices such as a virtual human could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. if you get up at three o'clock in the morning and you go downstairs there are probably two things you are going to do either going to the bathroom or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea said dr bowden. now if the system can watch your behaviour over time it can learn this so it would predict what you are going to do turn on the lights for you or before you even get to the kettle it could have switched it on. you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future. but it might all depend on the face that is watching you. when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them said dr bowden. but when jeremiah's camera went in nobody minded because although it's still watching them they could see what it was watching.,2
mourinho defiant on chelsea form chelsea boss jose mourinho has insisted that sir alex ferguson and arsene wenger would swap places with him. mourinho's side were knocked out of the fa cup by newcastle last sunday before seeing barcelona secure a 21 champions league firstleg lead in the nou camp. but he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals arsenal and manchester united could exploit. they cannot speak to us about blips because they're not in a better position than us mourinho said. do they want to change positions with us we are top of the league by nine points and in the carling cup final. the only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the fa cup. in the champions league all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still chelsea. mourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective. don't try to put pressure on me because i am never under pressure he warned. we have lost one important game this week  at newcastle  and we're out of the fa cup but i don't think a defeat in a firstleg tie is a real defeat. we are just 21 down at halftime. asked if his chelsea honeymoon was now over mourinho replied i have had 20 years of honeymoons with my wife. the day that this club is not happy with me is the day that i go.,1
commons hunt protest charges eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct. the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. those charged included otis ferry the 22yearold son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson 27 a close friend of princes william and harry. they were charged under section 5 of the public order act police said. five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening after the charges were formerly put to them. the men's solicitor matthew knight said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence. there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons  it is not a criminal offence he said. if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so but it can't do so retrospectively. we are not prosecuted for that. we are prosecuted for a public order act offence. we are not guilty of it. they will appear at bow street magistrates' court on 21 december a police spokesman said. otis ferry a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt said i have no regrets. we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country. one of the men david redvers 34 from hartpury gloucestershire said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges. the other protesters are john holliday 37 a huntsman from ledbury herefordshire robert thame 34 who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove auctioneer andrew elliot 42 from bromesberrow near ledbury pointtopoint jockey richard wakeham 34 from york and former royal chef nick wood 41. the 15 september protest came on the same day as a huge prohunting demonstration in parliament square. four of the men ran out from behind the speaker's chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber. speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. in november the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales. however many prohunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. last week the countryside alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. the alliance said the 19 february meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations.,0
candidate resigns over bnp link a prospective candidate for the uk independence party ukip has resigned after admitting a brief attachment to the british national partybnp. nicholas bettsgreen who had been selected to fight the suffolk coastal seat quit after reports in a newspaper that he attended a bnp meeting. the former teacher confirmed he had attended the meeting but said that was the only contact he had with the group. mr bettsgreen resigned after being questioned by the party's leadership. a ukip spokesman said mr bettsgreen's resignation followed disclosures in the east anglian daily times last month about his attendance at a bnp meeting. he did once attend a bnp meeting. he did not like what he saw and heard and will take no further part of it the spokesman added. a meeting of suffolk coastal ukip members is due to be held next week to discuss a replacement. mr bettsgreen of woodbridge suffolk has also resigned as ukip's branch chairman.,0
broadband fuels online change fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online research suggests. a quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites according to a report by uk thinktank demos. it said that having an alwayson fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. more than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. the demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. it found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. one in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. more significantly argues the report broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online. it found that one in five post something on the net everyday ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs. broadband is putting the 'me' in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual said john craig coauthor of the demos report. from selfdiagnosis to online education broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed. the demos report entitled broadband britain the end of asymmetry was commissioned by net provider aol. broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the uk said karen thomson chief executive of aol uk with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio. according to analysts nielsennetratings more than 50 of the 22.8 million uk net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed they spend twice as long online than people on dialup connections viewing an average of 1444 pages per month. the popularity of fast net access is growing partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services.,2
radcliffe will compete in london paula radcliffe will compete in the flora london marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005. the 31yearold won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 april race. it doesn't get any better than this for the 25th anniversary said race director david bedford. after announcing the greatest men's field ever we now have the greatest women's distance runner ever. three years ago radcliffe smashed the women's world record in two hours 18 minutes 15 seconds. the bedford star returned to london 12 months later lowering her mixedrace world record of 21718 which she set in chicago in october 2003 by one minute 53 secs. radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the olympic marathon and later dropped out of the athens 10000m last august. but the 31yearold bounced back to win the new york marathon in november. radcliffe however passed up the chance to go for the big city marathon grand slam. with wins in chicago london and new york only the boston marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after london. boston is definitely a race i want to do at some point but london is very special to me said radcliffe. i don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. i pick the ones in my heart i really want to do. i love the atmosphere crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. it is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.,1
reboot ordered for eu patent law a european parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new european union rules which govern computerbased inventions. the legal affairs committee juri said the commission should resubmit the computer implemented inventions directive after meps failed to back it. it has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact opensource software innovation. supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention. the draft law suffered setbacks when poland one of the largest eu member states rejected its adoption twice in two months. intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. only two meps backed the draft law at the juri meeting with one voting to abstain. opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the eu a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the usbased amazon.com holds a patent for its oneclick shopping service for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.,2
nat insurance to rise say tories national insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election tory leader michael howard has claimed. tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labour's manifesto. prime minister's questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad  but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too. the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have promised 4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies' predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an 11bn gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance he added everyone knows tax will go up under labour isn't it now clear which tax it would be mr blair instead hailed labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals that money is not wasted he said. on the tax questions he added we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto. home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants with only highskilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union. mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres  what he called a fantasy island. mr howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair said all the other countries could not agree on the way forward nor could the un.,0
assembly ballot papers 'missing' hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the north east have disappeared. royal mail says it is investigating the situation which has meant about 300 homes in county durham are not receiving voting packs. officials at darlington council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation. the allpostal votes of about two million electors are due to be handed in by 4 november. a spokesman for darlington council said we have sent out the ballot papers the problem is with royal mail. somewhere along the line something has gone wrong and these ballot papers have not been delivered. the royal mail is investigating to see if they can find out what the problem is. a spokeswoman for royal mail said we are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the mowden area of darlington. this is affecting several hundred properties which have failed to receive ballot papers. we are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem. noone will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary. we are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote. the darlington council spokesman added initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now. we then made further investigations and it became clear this was a bigger issue. a spokeswoman for the electoral commission told bbc news online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected. she said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time. so far a total of 569072 ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the north east.,0
players sought for 1m prize uk gamers are getting a chance to take part in a 1m tournament thanks to one of the country's top teams. the fourkings clan is staging a pop idol type competition to find new members who can take on the world's best in the lucrative tournament. fourkings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the painkiller game. top players also get a contract with the fourkings team which will pay travelling expenses for the contest. uk gamers have until 12 november to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the fourkings jolt.co.uk and painkiller tournament websites. philip wride who comanages the fourkings team said online qualifiers will be held from 1628 november to find the best eight players of the painkiller game. he said the clan was running the contest because fourkings does not currently have any players that excel at painkiller. these eight players will be brought together in london on 35 december for the bloodline tournament that will find the best two players. the event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch. the movie is being put together by simon bysshe who has shot many other films about progaming that have been widely shared online. said mr bysshe painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up. painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches such as improved graphics to the oldfashioned firstperson shooter. these two players will be put forward as the uk's entrants to the cyberathlete professional league 1m painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005. the event is being billed as the cpl world tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world. travel expenses to all the stops on the tour will be paid by fourkings for the two uk players who make the grade. the top prize at each stop on the world tour will be 15000. a further 150000 will be given to the winner of the grand final due to be held in december 2005. mr wride said any gamer that wins a few tour stop tournaments and the grand final will have a very good year. the first stop on the world tour will be istanbul turkey from 1013 february. a total of 50000 in cash prizes is on offer. the cpl has said that it picked a oneonone game such as painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action. counterstrike by far the most popular online game pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played. the decision to pick painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers as it was widely expected that doom 3 would be chosen as the oneoneone title.,2
text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia. the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world though might know him better by his online name morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an ontheground assessment of who needs what and where. blogging friends in india took mr senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent. and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use. sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call he says. in every rural community there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages. half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi's messages. mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. he can message the server so the server can send out an email message and human or machine moderators can email aid agencies and get it out in the field. he added or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places. mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week he sent out email messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia. in only 72 hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain. the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use opensource software  software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint  and a farflung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people selforganizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people says paul saffo a director at the californiabased institute for the future. you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you're just one click or one email away he said that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy. it is still very early days for the project though. in an email dan lane calls it an early proof of concept. right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a webpage or distribute it to an email list. in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there's still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. it's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that says mr rampersad. so the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve  human communication. he is optimistic however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo criticise by creating. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction.,2

brown names 16 march for budget chancellor gordon brown will deliver his budget to the house of commons on 16 march the treasury has announced. the budget likely to be the last before the general election will be at 1230 gmt on that wednesday just after prime minister's question time. the annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. it is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election widely expected on 5 may. next month's budget will be mr brown's eighth since labour came to power in 1997. if a may election is called there could be as little as 18 days between the budget and the announcement of a date for the election. a shortened finance bill would have to be rushed through parliament with allparty support to allow the government to continue collecting revenue. the full finance bill with the budget measures in it would then be returned to the commons after the election if labour secures another term in office. as mr brown announced the budget date in a short ministerial statement accountancy firm ernst  young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the longterm requirements of the economy. in the budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and in many cases taxes were increased soon after the election result said aidan o'carroll ey's uk head of tax.,0
mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend's spar european indoor championships in madrid. the 28yearold has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites. i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield i can run my race from the front back or middle said mcilroy. new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroy's career back on track. the 28yearold 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the nononsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester. lester is better known for his work with 400m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season. mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in 1998. that was my last decent year said mcilroy who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester's shrewd guidance. before every race was like trying to climb mount everest and i now know you can't do it on your own. trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing halfdead and terrified on the starting line which became a bit too much. mcilroy who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding. that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the worldclass times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season. russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed. he admitted he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. i never write myself off and let's face it i haven't or looked like being beaten this season. and mcilroy whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk alltime list is also already looking beyond madrid. he said i've been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. ultimately of course this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer's world championships. that ambition has meant that i've had only two nights out since last august. the rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.,1
police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of 24drinking saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change. however norfolk police chief andy hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed. i don't subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it he said. his comments come after the liberal democrats backed tory demands that the government's plans be put on hold. andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans which come into force on 7 february. i feel that is a premature position to be taking he said. among those who have criticised the plans are the uk's top policeman sir john stevens. the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24hour drinking should be reexamined because of a binge drinking epidemic. however mr hayman said it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say 'i'm very sorry'. he said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation. my view is that i have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen  he said. however he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24hour drinking. but he is confident problems in the early days can be ironed out. he believed the majority of people favoured this law change and we have to accept that lifestyles are changing. but aspects such as transport and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account. prime minister tony blair has defended the licensing act saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in europe because of a tiny minority of violent binge drinkers. a sixmonth transitional period starts on 7 february during which time venues can apply for extended licences. the conservatives have called for 24hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved. on monday the lib dems also called for a delay. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said it would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours. chief constable mr hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems. if you come to norwich on a friday or saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed. however i want industry to succeed in norwich and i want norwich to be the recognised nightspot of east anglia. there is no way i want to say we cannot manage it or police it. we can.,0
blair stresses prosperity goals tony blair says his party's next manifesto will be unremittingly new labour and aimed at producing personal prosperity for all. the prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with gordon brown with the speech in chatham kent. he is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring radically improved public services. he is also claiming labour is more ideologically united than ever. mr brown is currently touring africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with downing street. with the election widely predicted for may angry labour mps this week warned mr blair and mr brown about the dangers of disunity. now mr blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of labour's platform for a third term in government. labour made low inflation unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week. and on thursday mr blair is saying i want to talk about the central purpose ofnew labour  which is to increase personal prosperity and wellbeing not justfor a few but for all. by prosperity i mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state. the tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. on wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and mr brown under the words how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other michael howard and frontbencher john redwood on thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. they say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make britain more competitive. the liberal democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. the latest speculation about relations between new labour's two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book brown's britain by robert preston. in it he alleges that mr blair told mr brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. the book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him. mr peston's book claimed that mr brown told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe. on wednesday mr blair directly denied mr brown made that quote and before he left for africa on tuesday the chancellor told reporters of course i trust the prime minister.,0
gta sequel is criminally good the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition. the 18 certificate gta san andreas for the playstation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a bestselling formula with a moreofthesame approach. instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the driv3r and true crimeshaped opposition. even in the year that will see sequels to halo and halflife it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic. the basic gameplay remains familiar. you control a character on this occasion a youth named cj who sets out on a series of selfcontained missions within a massive 3d environment. cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a pushbike to a city bus to a plane. all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family. to make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn. the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas comprising three major cities los santos which is a thinlydisguised los angeles san fierro aka san francisco and las venturas a carbon copy of las vegas. san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing. its ability to capture the ambience of the realworld versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city. the streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy. flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the game's overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous. the outstanding breadandbutter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on. cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and there's more traffic to navigate than before. park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pileup. pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch. cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad. they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over. clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in minigames like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym. he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of overeating. and at last this is a gta hero who can swim. at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young san andreas' violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the procensorship brigade. developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings. when hijacking a car for example cj will gratuitously shove the driver's head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle. indeed the tone is darker than the jokey vice city. the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game. this title incidentally is set in 1992 but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists. the wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings. a further reason for this is that the incredible range of invehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where gta games' trademark humour is anchored. the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply offthechart. the game's rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed. it is a testament to san andreas' magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but pluspoints are so numerous that the niggles don't detract. the onscreen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions. there is also a very jarring slowdown at actionpacked moments. and the game suffers from the ageold problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission. but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings. san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.,2
mps quiz aides over royal income senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the queen and prince of wales are to be questioned by mps. aides from the duchy of lancaster and duchy of cornwall will appear before the commons public accounts committee. it has been reported they could be questioned about prince charles' spending on camilla parker bowles. but bbc correspondent peter hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. duchy officials who will appear before the committee on monday are only responsible for generating money. the duchy of lancaster provides the queen's private income while the duchy of cornwall provides prince charles' annual income. the duchy of cornwall is a 140000acre estate across 25 counties and also includes residential properties shops offices stocks and shares. it was set up in 1337 by king edward iii to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. it covers the cost of the prince's public and private life  neither charles nor william and harry receive taxpayers' money from the civil list. however the prince of wales did receive over 4m from government departments and grantsinaid in 20034. the duchy last year generated almost 12m. the prince has voluntarily paid income tax  currently 40  since 1993.,0
uk gets official virus alert site a rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government. the service it safe will issue warnings about damaging viruses software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. the service will be free and those who sign up can get email or text alerts. the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. there is a clear need for easytounderstand and simple independent advice for nontechnically minded people who use computers either at home or at work said home office minister hazel blears. the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm. those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people. fulltime staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones. it safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items safe said roger cumming director of the national infrastructure security coordination centre niscc. the niscc which is running the service also stressed that those signing up would still need to use antivirus software firewalls and software updates to stay secure. warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. this might include downloading an update from an antivirus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. however no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. the alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. the niscc spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets. government statistics show that more than half of all uk households own a home computer. it was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. the launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. in september 2004 the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100000 mark. some fear that this figure could hit 150000 by september 2005. the creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the netherlands and us. the national alerting service for the netherlands aka de waarschuwingsdienst and the us national cyber alerting service also tell citizens of serious security threats.,2
rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions. rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal's 25yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers' hero saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson. striker novo secured victory lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining. it ended celtic's 11game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals. celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch including twice already this season. they started confidently with new signing bellamy on loan from newcastle united given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield. it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt. he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian. but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18yard drive. a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out. hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus. rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen broke the deadlock douglas somehow letting the frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp. novo pounced on a moments' hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas. ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin but it could not prevent rangers' celebrations at the final whistle.  douglas mcnamara balde varga laursen petrov lennon sutton thompson bellamy hartson. subs marshall henchoz juninho paulista lambert maloney wallace mcgeady.  waterreus hutton kyrgiakos andrews ball buffel ferguson ricksen vignal prso novo. subs mcgregor namouchi burke alex rae malcolm thompson lovenkrands.  m mccurry,1
redknapp's saints face pompey tie new southampton manager harry redknapp faces an immediate reunion with his old club portsmouth after they were drawn together in the fa cup fourth round. exeter city face a home tie against middlesbrough if they can see off holders manchester united in a replay. oldham's reward for beating manchester city is a home tie with bolton while yeovil will be away to charlton. chelsea host birmingham tottenham travel to west brom and arsenal will entertain championship side wolves. saints boss redknapp was upbeat about the draw despite having to face the club he walked out on just six weeks ago. i've said before i can walk away from portsmouth with my head held high i'm proud of what i did there and no one can take that away from me said redknapp. maybe i'll be in for some stick there's always some of that but we'll get on with it and it's only a game of football. birmingham manager steve bruce admitted their trip to stamford bridge to face premiership leaders chelsea was the toughest draw possible. bruce said i'm still in shock. we've given good accounts of ourselves against chelsea in the past and played well when we lost 10 at home at the start of the season  but that's the past. but it's the best competition in the world as far as i am concerned and we will give it our best shot. brentford boss martin allen remained cautious despite his side's favourable draw  a home tie with either hartlepool or boston. the best thing is it's a home game. however we know that whoever we play it is going to be a really tough game said allen. but it's not about the opposition it's about us. we all want to get through to the next round and face a massive team that's the way it is. meanwhile the bbc has confirmed it will be televising exeter's replay with man utd live on wednesday 19 january from 1930 on bbc one. derby v watford or fulham man utd or exeter v middlesbrough cardiff or blackburn v colchester chelsea v birmingham west ham v sheff utd oldham v bolton arsenal v wolverhampton everton v sunderland nottm forest v peterborough brentford v hartlepool or boston reading or swansea v leicester or blackpool burnley or liverpool v bournemouth southampton v portsmouth west brom v tottenham newcastle v coventry charlton v yeovil,1

games firms 'face tough future' uk video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns. fred hasson head of tiga which represents independent developers said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles. three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt. microsoft sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months. microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox 2 will be released in the us before the end of 2005. the new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games. mr hasson said in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers. he said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close. once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities he said. mr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines. that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website  codemasters climax and rebellion. as consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles. jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger. he added we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. each one has involved the death of some people. all companies said they were investing in new tools  called middleware  in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control. simon gardner president of climax's action studio said we are investing in superior tools and editors. we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams. it's vital we avoid huge teams. he said climax was already directing about 20 of its resources to preparation for next generation titles. mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent. if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out. mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more businesslike. there are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days. some of them are still making games for peer group approval  that has to stop.,2
straw praises kashmir moves the uk has welcomed the decision by india and pakistan to open a bus link across the ceasefire line dividing the disputed region of kashmir. foreign secretary jack straw touring south east asian countries praised the spirit of cooperation in achieving the breakthrough. media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process. mr straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to kashmiris. the bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in islamabad on wednesday. kashmiri politicians on both sides of the line of control which divides the region welcomed the move. in a statement mr straw said the bus service between srinagar and muzaffarabad will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades. this will make a real difference to the lives of kashmiris on both sides of the line of control he said. i warmly applaud the efforts of both india and pakistan to make this happen. this spirit of cooperation will i hope lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region. on thursday mr straw was in india visiting sikhism's holiest shrine the golden temple in amritsar where he tried his hand at making indian bread or roti. he is due to take part in talks with the indian government on friday. a second bus service linking the pakistani city of lahore with amritsar in india was also announced as well as a rail link between rajasthan state and pakistan's sindh province. both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in karachi and mumbai bombay. the mountainous region of kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than 50 years.,0
hospital suspends 'no welsh' plan an english hospital has suspended plans to stop treating welsh patients who have waited more than three months. hereford county hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. gps in wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. but after talks with powys health board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in january. hereford hospital trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. shocked health officials in powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. andy williams chief executive of powys local health board had said it was a totally unacceptable way to behave. mr williams had said he did not think it was a welshenglish issue but said hereford hospital was struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to powys. he had told bbc radio wales i have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients i am paying them to treat. but after the hospital had agreed to the suspension mr williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure welsh patients continued to be treated there. he said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between england and wales. the target is 12 months for welsh patients but just three months in england. the contract with the powys health board was worth 7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12 of its patients. in a statement before the suspension of the idea the welsh assembly government said the situation was unacceptable. but powys local health board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate said the assembly government. although we will be challenging hereford's decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients. they will be contacted by their gps in the next week. earlier david rose chief executive of hereford hospitals nhs trust had said it is with real regret that we have taken this step. we want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service. in 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6months and we want powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital. we appeal to powys local health board to allow powys people to choose hereford for their treatment.,0
mobile networks seek turbo boost thirdgeneration mobile 3g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second  up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a highspeed high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than 384 kilobits per second kbps on standard 3g networks. highspeed downlink packet access hsdpa  sometimes called super 3g  will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by ukbased research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canadabased wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers. while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in widearea networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements. the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma 3g he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised evdo. us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are expanding our network and deploying evdo technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint's vice president for technology development when the contract was announced. as part of 3bn in multiyear contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around 1bn on evdo technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.30.5 megabits a second and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2 the ukbased operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access hsdpa standard. using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson. siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10. siemens  in collaboration with the fraunhofer germansino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology  has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dialup phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second  must faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren't those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available

away as 2012 though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.,2
cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty cardinal cormac murphyo'connor has said. the head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will reiterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. the cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a terrible waste of money. he and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot he criticised the fact that billions have been spent on war instead of being used to bring people out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease. the cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to make history poverty. he added if the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears. the cardinal will touch on this theme again on friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2000 at westminster cathedral that peace is worth always striving for. how is it that peace has not arrived the cardinal will ask. how is it that there is war in iraq violence in the holy land and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace how can one wish a happy christmas for our fellow christians in iraq or in the holy land or those who suffer in africa unless you and i in whatever way is open to us say and do what makes for peace both the cardinal and archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in iraq before the war started. dr williams has since criticised the government over its case for war saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system. on friday the cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. it is possible it is real it is worth always striving for because of the promise of our saviour he will say. i also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community.  a spokesman said downing street had no comment to make. but prime minister tony blair has said he will put africa at the top of the agenda when britain chairs the g8 summit next year.,0
kilroy launches 'veritas' party exbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroysilk has said he wants to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party. mr kilroysilk who recently quit the uk independence partysaid our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas  latin for truth  would avoid the old parties' lies and spin. ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk. mr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks. and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election  that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon's ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas' deputy leader. ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. mr kilroysilk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week. it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections. while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said. i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in. and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight. mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down. its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk. he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now 'goodbye' he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead. this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further. thank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infighting. ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilk. if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another. so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country. kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroysilk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it's all flash and no real policy here let's hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurity. veritas the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the tootwee label of veritas symbolises that,0
casual gaming to 'take off' games aimed at casual players are set to be even bigger in 2005 according to industry experts. easytoplay titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. the trend shows that gaming is not just about bighitting games console titles which appeal more to hardcore gamers said a panel of experts. they were speaking before the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. the panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics. casual games like poker pool bridge bingo and puzzlebased titles which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices were gender neutral and different genres attracted different players. greg mills program director at aol said its figures suggested that sportsbased games attracted 90 of 18 to 24yearold males while puzzle games were played by 80 of females. games like bridge tended to attract the over50 demographic of gamers. but hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hispec pcs like halflife 2 or halo 2 on xbox also liked to have a different type of gaming experience. when hardcore gamers are not playing halo they are playing poker and pool based on our research said geoff graber director of yahoo games which attracts about 12 million gamers a month. with the growth of powerful pc technology and ownership broadband takeup portable players and mobile devices as well as interactive tv casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005 according to the panel. the focus for the coming year should be about attracting thirdparty developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles they agreed. we are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger said mr graber. casual games will get into their stride in 2005 will be really big in 2006 and will be about community. with more people finding more to do with their gadgets and highspeed connections casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of massmarket entertainment to more people. key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked. portal sites which offer casual games like aol yahoo and realarcade as well as other gamesondemand services allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. this aspect of community is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in 30 to 40 console or pc titles said the panel. about 120000 people are expected to attend the ces trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 january. the main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other allowing people to enjoy digital content like audio video and images when they want and where they want.,2
ferguson fears milan cutting edge manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said his side's task against ac milan would not be made any easier by the absence of andriy shevchenko. milan's talismanic european footballer of the year misses wednesday's champions league firstleg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. it's a loss to milan but it could be worse if they didn't have such quality to bring in ferguson said. how much they miss him i think they'll know tomorrow night. ferguson said milan's front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. they can play rui costa and play kaka forward. they can bring serginho in and they can play jon dahl tomasson he said. ferguson's own goalscoring talisman ruud van nistelrooy is fit again but the scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the dutchman who has not played for three months. ruud is the best striker in europe. what i have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long he said. his ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision. ferguson though is confident his young players particularly wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo are up to the task. we have an opportunity to win this cup this year no question about that he declared. with the maturity we see every week in ronaldo and rooney the return of van nistelrooy and the form of roy keane paul scholes and ryan giggs we must have a fantastic chance. it is a view shared by rooney who believes if we can get past milan we have a great chance. as soon as i knew we were playing milan i got excited. looking at the draw it is anyone's trophy but we have every chance. hopefully we can get to that final in turkey and bring the cup back to manchester. milan coach carlo ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted europe's most prestigious club title two seasons ago. milan beat juventus in a penalty shootout after a 00 tie at old trafford and ancelotti said we are all very happy to return to old trafford to play in the champions league and this will give us great motivation. ancelotti said he was aware of the threat united posed to his hopes of champions league glory. it's fundamental that we don't allow them to take control of the game. our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game he said. they have great quality in attack they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.,1
nintendo handheld given euro date nintendo's new handheld console the ds will launch in europe on 11 march the company has announced. the portable games machine which features touchscreen control will retail for 99 in the uk 149 euros. nintendo said 15 games would be available in the uk at launch with prices ranging from 19 to 29. more than 2.8 million ds consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the us and japan at the end of 2004. rival sony has said it will launch its first handheld console the psp in the us and europe before the end of march. the psp is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market despite sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers. the 15 games available on the european launch date will include nintendo's super mario 64 ds as well as titles from thirdparty developers such as ubisoft's rayman ds. more than 120 games are in development for the new console nintendo has said. the ds is backwards compatible with the game boy advance allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. additionally a shortrange wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the ds with a download play option which allows a group to play against each other even if just one person owns a copy. other features include a shortrange messaging application called pictochat and a builtin microphone which is used in sega's launch title project rub. nintendo has also announced a media adapter which will allow the console to play music and video on the move. the launch price of 99 149 euros compares favourably with the us price of 149 according to john houlihan editor of the computerandvideogames.com magazine. it's a very very competitive price point. there are some innovative features and nintendo has created quite a buzz he says. however the lineup of games could have been stronger. everyone wanted to see the eightplayer mario kart ds for example. mr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sony's new psp with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. the psp is a sexy bit of kit but sony's attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe so far mr houlihan said. the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of 2.6bn at the end of 2004 according to industry analysts screen digest. in the past games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in europe than in other parts of the world. however nintendo president satoru iwata said the company was pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the us and european launch. europe is an extremely important market for nintendo mr iwata added. nintendo raised its sales targets for the ds console last december after selling a million in the us and japan in just a few weeks.,2
final hunts held as ban looms hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal with more due out later. thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday. the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 gmt on friday. the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful. but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally. antihunt organisations for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday of the league against cruel sports told bbc news we've long urged them to go drag hunting  to follow an artificial scent  and that is what we hope they do. but if they continue to chase foxes to chase wild mammals around the countryside that's against the law and we're confident they'll be brought to justice. at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears. she said many people did not share the countryside alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue. farmer geoff brooks a senior member of the quorn hunt told bbc news people's lives revolved around hunting. he described the ban as ridiculous and badly thought out but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record. at the court of appeal on wednesday the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid. but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police. the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday. the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. a spokesman said basically it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields it will be based on intelligence and information received as well. the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. he said police would consider evidence submitted by antihunt organisations on its merits.,0
drink remark 'acts as diversion' the first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed. jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnell's comment was illadvised. the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland's binge drinking problems mr law said. scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark. mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. the onesentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk. mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and illadvised remark by the first minister. if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it. however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage. mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured. mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotland's fight against binge drinking. he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. mr law added i think the remark was illadvised  but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland. we don't want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness. he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him. he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark. the scottish national party's holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his illjudged comment and withdraw it immediately. in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. that is completely untrue. perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with  all for the sake of a simple soundbite.,0
kluft impressed by sotherton form olympic heptathlon champion carolina kluft was full of admiration for britain's kelly sotherton as the pair prepared to clash in birmingham. both will be in action on friday in the 60m hurdles and long jump ahead of the european indoor championships later this month in madrid. sotherton finished third behind the swede in athens and kluft said i knew about her she's a great girl. she looked very good early in the season and was competing really well. kluft showed impressive earlyseason form on tuesday in stockholm's ge galan meeting winning the sprint hurdles the long jump and the 400m. sotherton has also displayed promise with a new high jump personal best in sheffield at the combined norwich union european trials and aaa championships and a second place in the long jump behind jade johnson.,1
ban on hunting comes into force fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in england and wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight. the law faces a stiff test this weekend with the countryside alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. chief police officers spokesman nigel yeo said he expected most people would obey the law  by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. he said police would challenge the one of two isolated hunts which are threatening to break the law. but simon hart of the countryside alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. the definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. you can hunt a rat but not a mouse a rabbit but not a hare an artificial scent but not a real one he said. the attorney general lord goldsmith has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. he said he will consult the director of public prosecutions and the police in the near future to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. he has rejected a blanket policy of not enforcing the ban until the house of lords has considered its legality. john cooper a barrister and chairman of the league against cruel sports said the antihunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. he said police had acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences. the beaufort hunt had one pack out on thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them. as well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent it will still be legal for the hunts to flush out foxes as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. we are not going away. we will keep these hounds going we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again hunt master captain ian farquhar said. but tony banks labour mp for west ham said the issue would soon disappear and that people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about. he said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. let the election decide this because the conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting he said.,0
concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id rfid tags in shops a survey says. more than half of 2000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk france germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner  each item contains a unique identification number. more than half 55 of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham capgemini's principal consultant on rfid said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology. acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point. he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk  the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed 52 believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group  consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering caspian  has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings including clothes could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners it warned.,2
radcliffe yet to answer gb call paula radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the world crosscountry championships. the 31yearold is concerned the event which starts on 19 march in france could upset her preparations for the london marathon on 17 april. there is no question that paula would be a huge asset to the gb team said zara hyde peters of uk athletics. but she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training. radcliffe must make a decision by tuesday  the deadline for team nominations. british team member hayley yelling said the team would understand if radcliffe opted out of the event. it would be fantastic to have paula in the team said the european crosscountry champion. but you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. she is not messing us around. we all understand the problem. radcliffe was world crosscountry champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury. in her absence the gb team won bronze in brussels.,1
microsoft gets the blogging bug software giant microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging. it is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs or online journals called msn spaces. microsoft is trailing behind competitors like google and aol which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. blogs short for web logs have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online. msn spaces is free to anyone with a hotmail or msn messenger account. people will be able to choose a layout for the page upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. the service will be supported by banner ads. this is a simple tool for people to express themselves said msn's blake irving. this is microsoft's first foray into blogging which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. competitors like google already offer free services through its blogger site while aol provides its members with journals. accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. according to blog analysis firm technorati the socalled blogosphere has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. it now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.,2
consumers 'snub portable video' consumers want music rather than movies while on the move says a report. produced by jupiter research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13 of europeans want to watch video while out and about. by contrast almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an ipod. the firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible. the report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of europe's portable player market was likely to be music rather than films or any combination of the two. barely 5 of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies. only 7 wanted a player that could handle games and video. dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in europe today despite their high prices said ian fogg jupiter analyst. mr fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dualpurpose device. europeans care most about music playback he said. the report showed that 27 of consumers asked are interested in portable music players. the research revealed that french 39 and british 31 consumers were most interested in music players. mr fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback. a separate report by jupiter forecasts that the european digital music market will grow to 836m euros 581m by 2009. at the end of 2003 the market was worth 10.6m euros 7.36m. digital music players will be behind this market growth said jupiter . apple's ipod was launched in october 2001 but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the creative nomad jukebox in mid2000. now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of highcapacity portable music players that let them store every track on every cd that they own.,2
brown shrugs off economy fears gordon brown is to freeze petrol duty increases fund a 1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave. in an upbeat prebudget report he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in uk industrial history but denied he was gloating. but oliver letwin for the tories attacked government red tape and debt dubbing mr brown sir wastealot. the shadow chancellor said mr brown's golden rule had turned to dross in his hands and said he was borrowing to spend not invest with predicted debt over the coming years totalling 170bn. mr letwin told mps the tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. he is spending borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money. vincent cable for the liberal democrats accused mr brown of ducking tough choices. he said last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt. but they have not been confronted. mr brown rejected the lib dem's call to open up the government's books to the national audit office saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. bbc economic editor evan davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble. mr brown's insistence he was not gloating was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new european commissioner peter mandelson. in his speech he set out a 10year childcare strategy for if labour wins the next election. it includes a 285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. he also promised to increase free nursery education for three and fouryearolds to 15 hours from april 2007. and funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800gmt to look after children while their parents were at work. taken together the measures would create a welfare state that is truly familyfriendly for the first time in its history said mr brown. he also announced a cash handout for older pensioners with payments of 50 for the over70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. in a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5 next year the chancellor said he was providing an extra 1bn for local councils. the money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education. mr brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules  to borrow only to invest and keep debt low and sustainable  both in this economic cycle and the next. borrowing figures for 20034 are 35bn  2.5bn less than the 37.5bn predicted in march's budget as already announced by the office for national statistics. borrowing is tipped to fall to 31bn by 200506  but that is still 2bn more than mr brown predicted in his march budget. inflation would be 1.75 next year and 2 in the years to follow mr brown forecast. he also pledged an extra 105m for security and counterterrorism. business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. but there worries about the costs of more familyfriendly working. simon sweetman from the federation of small businesses said the proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.,0
short attacks us over tsunami aid former cabinet minister clare short has criticised the usled tsunami aid coalition saying the un should be leading efforts. president bush has announced that an alliance of the us india australia and japan will coordinate a humanitarian drive. but ms short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the un. she said only the un had the moral authority to lead the relief work. ms short resigned as international development secretary over the iraq war. i think this initiative from america to set up four countries claiming to coordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the un when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up she said. only really the un can do that job she told bbc radio four's pm programme. it is the only body that has the moral authority. but it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers. ms short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters. the us was very bad at coordinating with anyone and india had its own problems ms short said. i don't know what that is about but it sounds very much i am afraid like the us trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the un system she added.,0
new year's texting breaks record a mobile phone was as essential to the recent new year's festivities as a party mood and auld lang syne if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by. between midnight on 31 december and midnight on 1 january 133m text messages were sent in the uk. it is the highest ever daily total recorded by the mobile data association mda. it represents an increase of 20 on last year's figures. wishing a happy new year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year's largest party. while texting has not quite overtaken the oldfashioned phone call it is heading that way said mike short chairman of the mda. in the case of a new years eve party texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background he said. there were also lots of messages sent internationally where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible he said. the british love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn according to mda. the mda predicts that 2005 could see more than 30bn text messages sent in the uk. we thought texting might slow down as mms took off but we have seen no sign of that said mr short. more and more firms are seeing the value in mobile marketing. restaurants are using text messages to tell customers about special offers and promotions. anyone in need of a bit of january cheer now the party season is over can use a service set up by jongleurs comedy club which will text them a joke a day. for those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in the good pub guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub. users need to text the word goodpub to 85130. if they want to turn the evening into a pub crawl they simply text the word next. and for those still standing at the end of the night a taxi service in london is available via text which will locate the nearest available black cab.,2
minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and very clear alun michael has said. the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law which came into force on friday and pretended they were not. some 270 hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of 91 foxes  only four were accidentally killed by hounds. but antihunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting. people had turned out to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed legally as far as he was aware. although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence exercising hounds chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable mr michael told bbc radio 4's today programme there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. the reality is that the law is very clear. you can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. if people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear. you can't hunt accidentally. mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy the health service and their children's future than hunting. but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban with antihunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. there were only four arrests  over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire  although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act. they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. but penny little who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire said she had witnessed gratuitous spiteful killing of foxes. if people tried to run circles around this law the only outcome would be that it was tightened up she said. mike hobday from the league against cruel sports said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating antihunt activists videoing hunts. but mr jackson who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire denied there was any intimidation.,0
gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hitech products. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hitech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling. the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005. but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa. of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology. the consumer electronics association cea has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than 125.73 billion nearly 68 billion. ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. the online auction house thinks that its alreadyestablished community of loyal users could be influential. we really became aware of the ewaste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good ebay's david stern told the bbc news website. we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment. but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. yet only 15 are actually recycled. this year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a deloitte report. schemes in the us like ripmobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards 10 to 28yearolds for returning unused phones. this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile. one group of students collected 1000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour. europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free. there is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intel's allen wilson told the bbc news website. there is still lowlevel awareness right now but it is on the rise  the highest level of awareness is in europe. a european union eu directive weee waste electronic and electrical equipment comes into effect in august. it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. elements like chromium lead and cadmium  common in consumer electronics goods  will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006. but it is not just about recycling either. the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires. they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players. although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. on 1 january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct. but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about 35 more efficient. the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers' adaptors are being brought on board. most are made in china. about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone. the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22 of power supplies on the market. we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hitech devices but also bundle with it a hitech efficient power supply the epa's andrew fanara said. initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes said the epa.,2
euniversity 'disgraceful waste' a failed government scheme to offer uk university courses online has been branded a disgraceful waste by mps. the euniversity was scrapped last year having attracted only 900 students at a cost of 50m. chief executive john beaumont was paid a bonus of 44914 despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. the commons education select committee called this morally indefensible but the government said the euniversity project had improved understanding. a department for education and skills spokeswoman said the venture had been ambitious and groundbreaking but takeup had not been sufficient to continue with the project. she added uk euniversities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom. the select committee found that those responsible for founding the euniversity in 2000 had been caught up in the general atmosphere of enthusiasm surrounding the internet. initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade bringing in at least 110m in profit. but virtually no market research was carried out and just 4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. some 14m went on developing the technology to make the euniversity work. this was used by just 200 students the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. with no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister the euniversity had had too much freedom to spend public money as it wished the report found. committee chairman barry sheerman said uk euniversity was a terrible waste of public money. the senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary overconfidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme. the report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the euniversity but should learn the lessons from this disaster.,0
blair 'pressing us on climate' tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol downing street has indicated. officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair. climate change was an issue the prime minister wanted to progress during the uk's presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005 said a spokesman. but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new usfriendly treaty. according to the times the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a kyotolite agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10. the prime minister is said to believe the united states' refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries' resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty  which aims to cut emissions  branding it politically motivated and not based on science. president bush's advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place. europe which disputes the claim has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries. mr blair's reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions says the times. but there is still apparently little prospect of america agreeing to cut emissions which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20 cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.,0
greek pair set for hearing kostas kenteris and katerina thanou will fight the provisional twoyear bans imposed on them by the iaaf at an independent tribunal this weekend. athletics' ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. an independent tribunal of the greek track and field federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. the sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. kenteris' lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted. ioannidis who is a law lecturer at the university of buckingham added one of the important rights and foundations of law and justice  that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise  has been tarnished. the panel will also decide on the twoyear ban imposed on the athletes' controversial coach christos tzekos by the iaaf. kenteris the 2000 olympic 200m champion and thanou the women's 100m silver medallist from the same games in sydney quit the olympics on 18 august after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony. testers could not find them at the olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. they also missed tests in tel aviv chicago and athens before the games. in imposing twoyear suspensions on the duo on 22 december the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as unacceptable. whatever the findings of the independent tribunal all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. the tribunal hearing will take place at the hellenic olympic committee building. it will start at 1200 gmt on saturday and is expected to finish early next week. the tribunal panel will consist of five members  president konstantinos panagopoulos and panagiotis dimakos haralabos hrisanthakis stilianos perakis and ioannis karmis. kenteris and thanou also face criminal charges in greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as tzekos an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials. but there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped.,1
butler strikes gold in spain britain's kathy butler continued her impressive year with victory in sunday's 25th cross internacional de venta de banos in spain. the scot who led gb to world cross country bronze earlier this year moved away from the field with ines monteiro halfway into the 6.6km race. she then shrugged off her portuguese rival to win in 20 minutes 38 seconds. meanwhile briton karl keska battled bravely to finish seventh in the men's 10.6km race in a time of 3141. kenenisa bekele of ethiopia  the reigning world long and short course champion  was never troubled by any of the opposition winning leisurely in 30.26. butler said of her success i felt great throughout the race and hope this is a good beginning for a marvellous 2005 season for me. elsewhere abebe dinkessa of ethiopia won the brussels iaaf crosscountry race on sunday completing the 10500m course in 33.22. gelete burka then crowned a great day for ethiopia by claiming victory in the women's race.,1
collins appeals against drugs ban sprinter michelle collins has lodged an appeal against her eightyear doping ban with the north american court of arbitration for sport cas. the 33yearold received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal. she is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. cas has said that a ruling is normally given within four months of an appeal. collins was suspended by the us antidoping agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the balco investigation. as well as being hit with the ban collins was stripped of her 2003 world and us indoor 200m titles. the san franciscobased balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport. the company has been accused of distributing illegal performanceenhancing drugs to elite athletes.,1
muslim police stops 'more likely' uk muslims should accept that people of islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police a home office minister has said. hazel blears said innocent muslims would be targeted because of the search for islamic extremists. qualifications for religious leaders to enter the uk could also be made tougher she told a commons inquiry. her comments have been described as irresponsible and outrageous by the islamic human rights commission ihrc. the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of islam or who are falsely hiding behind islam the salford mp told the commons home affairs committee. it means that some of our counterterrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the muslim community. it was a reality that should be recognised she said. if a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area she added. on ministers of religions such as imams she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community should be demanded. last year ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak english to a certain level. ihrc chairman massoud shadjareh accused ms blears of playing an islamophobia card in the runup to a general election. she is demonising and alienating our community he said. it is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. this sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists. later the prime minister's official spokesman urged people to put ms blears' comments into context. the minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community but that was not what was happening the spokesman said. what is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. it is not aimed at a particular community it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community he added. statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the uk since the 11 september attacks only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were muslim he added figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics. figures showed that for 20032004 asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. separate figures on police searches in england and wales carried out under the terrorism act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. in 20032004 12.5 searches under the laws were on asian people even though they make up 4.7 of the population. last july the police were accused of islamophobia by muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of asians targeted had risen by 300 since the introduction of antiterror laws.,0
apple ipod family expands market apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players. its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of 40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold 10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store which has given the company a 70 share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire a research director at analyst gartner told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in sealing off the market from competition so far. they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product  the design function and the software are very impressive he said. he added that the threat from others was always present however. creative other microsoftpartnered devices real sony and so on are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year he said. its secondgeneration models like the creative zen micro photo is due out in the summer. it will have 5gb of memory on board. digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in 10 us adults  22 million people  now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004 according to the record industry with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows called podcasts. but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music which they can do with highcapacity storage devices like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.,2
visa decision 'every 11 minutes' visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes mps have said. pressure was placed on staff to be efficient rather than to do a thorough examination of an application the public accounts committee found. every officer had an annual target of 8000 applications  equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. mps want research into whether uk visa holders leave at the end of their stays or vanish into the black market. committee chairman edward leigh said there is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents.  the committee's report also discussed the romanian and bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister beverley hughes last year. committee members said the home office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. investigations carried out in the wake of ms hughes' resignation found more than 7000 people had entered the uk under the business visa scheme for romanian and bulgarian entrepreneurs. mr leigh said the home office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. a home office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. he added that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all preentry applications will be replaced by a single preentry check at post which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system.,0
anglers 'could face prosecution' anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty a committee of mps has warned. sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said. the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said. they called for a castiron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care. in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals  unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest. the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged  even if they were to later fail. we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government's intention to exempt fishing as an activity. but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added. the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened. mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted  such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering  to go unpunished. committee chairman michael jack said any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. this draft bill is no exception. my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place. but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of a 'work in progress' and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms. the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added.,0
britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went handinhand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals. kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope paula radcliffe dropped out of the marathon and then the 10000m. britain's men's 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic buildup was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m  her first global title. just five days later the 34yearold made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middledistance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games. the 30yearold marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november's new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some lastgasp glory for the british men's olympic squad after a poor start to the games. it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and just like holmes finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb's athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28yearold won her first championship medal since becoming a fulltime athlete in 2003. but it was a different story for britain's defending champion denise lewis who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis who was troubled by injury has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35yearold leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze. and backley's departure was balanced by the return of injuryhit decathlete dean macey who came fourth in athens. the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. kenteris the 200m champion in 2000 and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games adrian annus hammer robert fazelas discus and irina korzhanenko shot were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. the fallout from the thg scandal which rocked the sport in 2003 continued to impact in olympic year. britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers who was handed a twoyear ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg. american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco's hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5000m. and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.,1
citizenship event for 18s touted citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday charles clarke has said. the idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches inclusive citizenship particularly for ethnic minorities. a pilot scheme based on ceremonies in australia will start in october. mr clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. britain's young black and asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their other cultural identities alongside being british. the launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in britain. on monday school inspection chief david bell accused some islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to british society. the muslim council of britain said ofsted boss mr bell's comments were highly irresponsible. the home office started work on its community cohesion and race equality strategy last year and the outcome launched on wednesday is called 'improving opportunity strengthening society'. it is aimed at tackling racism exclusion segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. it represents a move away from the onesizefitsall approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups said a home office spokesman. it is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged. the spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities  for example people of south asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease. it is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems the spokesman added. launching the initiative mr clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. he added but while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare education or housing. this strategy sets out the government's commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society. some 8 of the uk population described themselves as coming from a nonwhite ethnic minority in the 2001 census. the downing street strategy unit in 2003 said people from indian and chinese backgrounds were doing well on average often outperforming white people in education and earnings. but those of pakistani bangladeshi and black caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites it said. the home office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. the programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.,0
muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives. the event is being held by the muslim association of britain mab which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. last year mab which opposed the war in iraq urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections. but a spokesman stressed the meeting was not necessarily antilabour. this meeting is not antiparty in particular it's antipolicy it's on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday's event. there are issues of concern to muslims and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues. dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq the palestinian situation the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic social and education problems. approximately 1.1m of the uk's 1.6m muslims are of voting age. previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters. anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason with many saying it was unjustified. representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday's event. among them will be the muslim council of britain mcb. the chairman of the mcb's public affairs committee sher khan said the war in iraq would be a significant factor affecting muslims' voting intentions. i think it's going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact mr khan said. however professor john curtice of the university of strathclyde is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make. for the most part the labour constituencies where there's a large muslim community are relatively safe but there are one or two that are not quite so safe professor curtice said. the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green in east london and rochdale in lancashire he added. in bethnal green former labour mp george galloway who founded the antiwar party respect is standing against sitting mp oona king who had a 10000vote majority in 2001. in rochdale the liberal democrats  the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour  secured second place in the 2001 election securing just under 6000 votes fewer than labour's lorna fitzsimons. but professor curtice said the muslim antiwar vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats which is generally the case he said. but dr tamimi said mab's intention was not to empower the tories. we know the next government will be labour but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly. if the next labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country dr tamimi said.,0
open source leaders slam patents the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents. in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. linux is a freelyavailable alternative to microsoft's windows. it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available. other companies are expected to follow suit. there are between 150000 and 300000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office. some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can't afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office. some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. if totally pushed to the wall  because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they're going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying. microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member. as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have coexisted for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland. the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added.,2
